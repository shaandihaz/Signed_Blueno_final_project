As far as the people worried about medical students being in difficult positions where they can’t take classes S/NC, I can’t imagine that a medical school would not understand if you explained that you were unable to cope in the middle of a GLOBAL PANDEMIC. As far as any kind of reason goes, that’s as good as gets and I’m certain as someone with 2 pre-med siblings at Brown that you will have the opportunity to explain. They'll understand if you needed to S/NC because you were in a de-stabilising position or your family was affected but someone else was in a more privileged position. HOWEVER, how will others who need their grades this semester, especially upperclassmen, be able to cope with this, especially when they don’t have had reduced courseloads or a bad GPA due to similarly extenuating circumstances in the past few semesters (severe mental or physical health issues, loss of a family member etc.)? Although people argue that those who want S/NC to be an option, not something that is forced, should “get off their high horse”, I hope you guys can at least attempt to sympathise with people in this position. Some students need these grades due to equally extenuating, difficult circumstances in the past, and deserve the option to take them for a grade if they want to, just as those in difficult circumstances now deserve the option to take them S/NC.\"\n","date":"Mar 19, 2020, 11:03 AM"},{"content":"\"1681* - topic: dem nom\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nFuck it, you gave us Joe Biden.

Those who’s families cannot support them, who never learned how to write an essay in their 50-person high school English class, who worry about affording food (let alone a 2 week supply) are set up to sink. Those with privilege and institutional knowledge get waterwings and swimming lessons, then get an A as a trophy to show off their hard earned (?) success. There are of course exceptions; there is no shortage of successful, brilliant, underprivileged people, nor a dearth of dedicated, hardworking silver-spooners. But this slight flexibility of the grading system is just enough to fool us into believing in meritocracy. Never forget that we are primarily graded on our privilege, not our ability, especially in a moment of global crisis.\"\n","date":"Mar 19, 2020, 11:03 AM"},{"content":"\"1677* - topic: grades\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n(firstly, I'm in support of making all classes s/nc)\nWhen people go back home, the existing disparities in class privilege become even more apparent than on campus. It's not about the grade. It's about making sure that people are not penalized for having less resources back home.

Some of you have extremely valid reasons. Some of you are hyper competitive and fail to understand the enormity of this pandemic (ofc grad schools will know why all your classes are s/nc in spring 2020). The real reason that it should be a mandatory s/nc is fairness. Many students are coming home to parents who no longer have a source of income and are forced to contribute to finding the next meal. The students who will have the luxury to choose to take courses for a grade are not the ones who will be hit hardest by this pandemic and economic collapse. Additionally, online classes will be a shitshow. Some professors will adapt better than others, creating inequity between classes.

Many of you don’t want to put everyone on S/NC because of this exact reason, and it’s quite ableist to expect that hardworking students would either have to take a lower grade due to the barriers they now face or opt into S/NC for their courses and decrease the “value” of their transcript.\n\nI think the net loss in whatever harm the grade inflation does (I personally doubt employers and grad schools will really look at or judge the measures Brown takes to mitigate the toll of this pandemic on our academic abilities) of giving everyone A’s will be massively offset\nby its emotional and academic boon alongside making up for the increased barriers many - if not most - students now face without forcing them to have to choose between a lower grade and “devaluing” their work through S/NC.\n\nIn my mind, the most widely appealing solution is to allow students to freeze their grades where they are right now as a representation of their traditional academic performance or unfreeze them if they want to try to raise those grades, but I nonetheless think that giving everyone A’s is already far better than either keeping the system as it is or only giving out extended S/NC deadlines.\"\n","date":"Mar 18, 2020, 3:05 PM"},{"content":"1647* - before this year, i can’t even remember the last time I cried. but in the last 5 days, I’ve cried 3 times as the weight of realizations hit me.

I think it’s safe to say that COVID counts as a major problem for all our academic pursuits, and the transition to online classes makes things extraordinarily difficult for those who rely on attending in-person lectures and sections to learn.

However, I'm thinking about all the people I've met in the week before I got the email, and even without having been to large gatherings, I had contact with dozens of people. Some of them have elderly family members, and one individual I've seen is immunocompromised. But I didn't even know I had contact with a positive tester at this point, so had I been carrying the virus without symptoms (fingers crossed this isn't the case), it would be a big problem.

We don’t have the luxury of being able to return in the fall, to have another shot of normalcy, to see our friends in person again. \n\nIt can be obnoxious hearing about how we won’t have a ~ senior spring ~.

Some of us won’t ever do primal scream, or the scili challenge, or tell that one person our true feelings, or try out PVDonuts, or check out the theatre on Thayer street, or even walk across a graduation stage- all trivial in the grand scheme of things, sure, but it’s the fact that we truly have no time or space to properly process any of this. That the universe essentially threw a big middle finger at any plans, control, or stability we may have perceived to have over our lives. There’s a suddenness and finality that have caused most of my friends to break down this week.\n\nSo, some people party and drink in order to cope. Given recent news of the covid case from Saturday, obviously throwing a rager wouldn’t be the most appropriate thing to do now, or even before then; and coronavirus themed parties are straight up insensitive imo. As an Asian with all my relatives in china, you can miss me with some of this racist Party theme shit. I can’t condone their actions- but, I can understand where they’re coming from, even in their ignorance. In the small parties I did go to, it was a space for us to acknowledge our sadness and grieve together while enjoying each other’s company for the last time, and distract ourselves from the pain of it all.\n\nIt felt like nothing really mattered anymore, but \nalso like everything started to matter all too much all at once for the very first time. \n\nIdk I guess I’m just apologizing on behalf of some members of my class, but also asking for some empathy and kindness during this time.

The coronavirus has me feeling the full weight of being a low-income student. In this moment when many of my peers, unencumbered by the constraints of finances, only need to concern themselves with putting their items in storage and getting back home, I have to ask: will I have enough to eat if/when I get back home ? Will I be safe at home? How am I going to support my family if I can't work my on-campus job? If I go home, where am I going to sleep, the couch or the floor? My family doesn't have adequate health insurance so how much can I pay out of pocket to help with medical expenses? How much will the University health insurance cover me out-of-state should I fall ill? Will I have the money for co-pays or a hospital stay? Where should I put my items in storage? Can I afford it? \n\nI hope the University will help financially where it can, but its incredibly isolating when so many of my peers don't have as many layers to think through. Its odd to rub shoulders with the children of some of the world's wealthiest people, to be just as talented, intelligent, and capable but to know the only thing that seperates us is that one of us was born lucky and the other not-so-much. To know that much of that wealth was built on the backs of working-class people like me . Its odd to know that some students come from families with multiple homes, some in isolated locations where they can bunker down and wait this pandemic out comfortably, but some of us have nowhere to go at all. I know I'll figure out the answer to all these questions but even now when we are all suffering, we're not all suffering the same. I feel so vulnerable.

I found it useful to keep them in loop for help in the process. In order to get accommodations you have to go through neuropsych testing I think, though that is not a required part of adhd diagnosis in general and this is expensive. SEAS helped cover my copay after the fact if that's something people need too. You can just ask them I think. Personally I used Neuropsychology Partners in East Providence, it was a good experience. For time scale, it took me super long :(, but it probably varies by place. First getting a slot with SEAS took some weeks (but it was mid sem so idk). All the testing jazz happens on one day (in the place i went to) and takes like 6 hrs so I couldn't find any time on a weekday morning to do it during the semester. Also these places have long lines. So there was a two month gap between booking the appointment after emailing back and forth and going. It took them 2ish more weeks to get back on a full report but I got a confirmation on that day. One can get interim accommodations from SEAS while all this waiting is happening. Also SEAS and Health Services can give info on therapy, support groups around here, coaching etc if one asks though you could prob google or use zencare. Anyway, I hope this is helpful.

A likely 7-2 SCOTUS, and another massive chunk of lifetime federal judge appointments.\n\nThis means unfavorable rulings for: climate change, abortion, gerrymandering, executive power, executive oversight, Congressional authority, civil rights, immigration issues (children in cages), and so, so much more. You can basically say goodbye to this for decades to come with a Trump Presidency. Everything Bernie, Warren, Democrats, and progressives ever stood for is going to take a sledgehammer with a Trump Presidency.\n\n• ⁠It would mean the continuing takeover of an authoritarian rule. Trump has argued he is immune from indictments, from oversight, from the courts, and he has a DOJ and Republican Senate to help him solidify his role as America's King.\n• ⁠It would mean further emboldening of a worrying white nationalist, conspiratorial presence in America. Racism, sexism, xenophobia, wild conspiracies, and more would be given a green light.\n• ⁠The continued isolation of America on the world stage. Every country on the planet besides NK, Saudi Arabia, and Russia does. not. trust. us. anymore. We are a mockery on the world stage in everything we do.\n• ⁠The most corrupt cabinet in history. William Barr, Betsy DeVos, Mnuchin, Wheeler, Pence. It's like a super team of unqualified, horrendous people with enormous conflicts of interest. Every position is basically hired to deconstruct the agency they work for. The intelligence community is being flat-out purged for loyalists.\n• ⁠A continuing WAR against climate change efforts and science. Undoubtedly the biggest issue humanity, including our children, grandchildren, and beyond will face.\n\nNo matter what your criticisms of Biden are,\n\nLet's remember who Trump is:\n\n-Trump defrauded the government of $400 million dollars.\n-Trump ran a fraudulent charity (one that supported veterans and children with cancer) and university.\n-Trump cheated on his third wife with a porn star and illegally paid her to keep quiet before an election.\n-Trump committed at least 5 felony instances of Obstruction of Justice., including trying to get Mueller (the man investigating him) fired... twice.\n-Trump was impeached for Obstruction of Congress and Abuse of Power.\n-Trump killed a top general of a hostile nation that posed no imminent threat.\n-Trump has over twenty sexual misconduct/assault allegations.\n-Trump tried to lie about a hurricane by extending a forecast with a fucking sharpie on a map because he couldn't admit he made a mistake on twitter.\n-Trump doesn't believe in climate change.\n-Trump thinks windmills cause cancer and raking prevents forest fires.\n-Trump is a stable genius - The \"\"nuclear\"\" quote - Another classic\n-Trump's only \"\"political experience\"\" prior to becoming President was fueling a racist conspiracy theory that Obama was born in Kenya.\n-Trump told a group of minority Congresswomen (3 of which born in America) to \"\"go back\"\" to the countries they came from.\n-Trump got on the stage at Helsinki to tell the world he trusts Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agencies.\n\nI'm not asking anyone to vow to vote blue tonight.

Also I get that it’s more serious than a common cold, but you know who’s dying from covid? 95 year olds in nursing homes, not 19 year old college students! \n4) each mask you buy endangers EMS who ACTUALLY need the masks to treat people with the virus. Also guess what? If we don’t have masks, we aren’t going to go take care of the patient who’s actually sick, and then they’ll spread it around to y’all. \n5) Please stop buying masks!\n6) Washing your hands is so much more effective than wearing an N95.

Shall I be more cautious?】 ⭐️\nThe known symptoms for the flu and COVID-19 are nearly identical: fever, cough, body aches and fatigue. However, there are a couple of important differences:\n\n1️⃣The average incubation period for the flu is two days, but for for COVID-19 it's ❗️2-14 days❗️. This is exactly why the outbreak in China was so bad. People without apparent symptoms traveling around the country, later causing a sudden increase in reported cases. \n\n2️⃣The coronavirus seems to be more deadly than the flu so far. The global case fatality rate for people infected with coronavirus was 3.4 percent according to the WHO, where as the death rate from seasonal flu is typically around 0.1% in the U.S.\n\n3️⃣How contagious it is. Each person with the coronavirus appears to infect 2.2 other people, comparing to roughly 1.3 for the flu. \n\nYou SHOULD be cautious. The death rate for a young and healthy person is low, and yes, it might not be too much worse than a flu. But the terrifying thing about a pandemic is the spreading. COVID-19 can be very deadly for older people or people with underlying conditions. If there's an outbreak at Brown, the most impacted could be faculty and staff with older/immunosuppressed family members who live together with them, and your own family members if you travel back home for spring break. Taking action is our responsibility as a community member. \n\n⭐️【Why are my Chinese international friends so stressed and cautious?】⭐️\nBecause we are watching the same process happening again, in the exact same way. About two months ago when I was back in Beijing, the situation of the outbreak, the government's actions, and the public reaction were strikingly similar to how the US was responding in the past two weeks. Government thinking that the outbreak would be under control, people believing that the cases would be limited to a few locations, testing not being distributed widely so confirmed cases were artificially low, large gatherings still going on with no precautions. But then all of a sudden the number of cases skyrocketed, mostly community spread. Seeing the exact same process developing again in the US has been extremely frustrating and hopeless, especially when we know that the US had a chance to avoid an outbreak by learning from what has happened in China, Korea, Italy, etc. \n\n⭐️【Why are some people wearing masks? 】⭐️\nIn some places/cultures, such as where I'm from, wearing a mask is not associated with being sick. Some people are used to seeing people on the street wearing masks for pollution and flu prevention etc etc. Research on the effectiveness of mask in preventing flu infection shows mixed results. In fact, both WHO and the US CDC suggest that healthy individuals don't need to wear a mask. However, with regards to the coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese public health/medical officials have been suggesting (or even enforcing) mask wearing for several reasons (that might be unique to the situation in China) - extremely high traffic load around the Chinese New Year (around 3 billion travels across the entire nation), high population density making hand-washing in public areas not that accessible, and most importantly, the 2-14 days incubation period of the coronavirus leading to many potential asymptomatic virus-carriers that could lead to uncontrollable spreading in urban areas with dense population. Thus, some Chinese students might bring this mindset and decide to wear a mask to protect themselves and OTHERS AROUND THEM. They are on the more cautious side, but definitely not unreasonable considering the long incubation period making a lot of people potential virus carriers. It's everybody's personal choice, and since the research is showing mixed results, everybody has a valid reason.\"\n","date":"Mar 8, 2020, 11:26 PM"},{"content":"\"17272 - topics: coronavirus\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nIf someone has a fever for 2+ days and has been sick for more they DO NOT have a cold. @brownhealthservices can suck my ass\"\n","date":"Mar 8, 2020, 11:26 PM"},{"content":"17271 - Is it true that Brown will pay for your first GRE or GMAT exam?

Especially when young voters don't vote. Instead of just attacking Biden over and over and failing to understand why he might be more electable, you might wanna look at your own guy a little bit better.

To what extent do you believe that historic oppression of a person’s ancestors can be equated to present-day oppression? As an example, I am Jewish, and I grew up rarely encountering explicit antisemitism (at least in-person) and I don’t think being Jewish has ever been used against me in a hiring decision or something like that. But if you go back just two or three more generations, my ancestors were beaten, killed, imprisoned, exiled, etc. because of their religion, and that was pretty common on and off for literally thousands of years. \n\nMy question is, what does that mean for me? Black Americans continue to experience discrimination and bigotry that clearly stem from the evils of the past. But in my case, all of the horrible stuff that happened to my ancestors doesn’t really harm me in any clear way. I think this is a common feeling among American Jews. Many of us are pretty well-off socioeconomically. We tend to look similar to white Christians. We are well represented in politics and other positions. That all protects us from a lot of the oppression that our ancestors faced, which is great. But it also allows us and others to forget that Jews have been and are an oppressed people. So to what extent can Jews identify as an oppressed group that deserves support and solidarity from others? Or should a well-off American Jew just be thankful that they are now privileged, unlike their ancestors?

YOU DON’T NEED TO CLAIM SOMETHING THATS TRUE OR OBVIOUS WHEN YOU COULD JUST GET TO THE GOD DAMNED POINT AND SAY IT!!! Don’t belittle my intelligence by prefacing your statement by a disclaimer that I might be too stupid to believe what you’re about to say or that I need you to spell out for me your fucking argument, WHEN THERE IS NO ARGUMENT.\n\n“I claim that my burger is undercooked.” SHUT THE FUCK UP and show me the BURGER! I have eyes, you don’t have to write down a function describing the temperature of the meat at every point in space and write down the fucking heat equation and explain to me that the burger only cools down out of the oven. IM NOT A FUCKING IDIOT.\n\n(Talking to someone else:) “I claim that you should put effort into this pset.” EVERYONE SHOULD BE PUTTING EFFORT INTO THEIR GOD DAMNED PSETS. Do you really think the person you’re talking to DOESNT fucking know they’re a student, and that their priority should be to do the psets so as to LEARN AND MASTER THEBFUXKING MATERIAL\n\n“I claim that so and do dining hall is better than another dining hall.” you BRAINWASHED TROGDOLYTE. I know god damn well that you didn’t conduct a rigorous fuckjng SCIENTIFIC STUDY into what makes dining halls better. Do you not know that what you’re about to say is a fucking OPINION and not a FACT??? You’re about to make a subjective statement of opinion. SO THE EVIDENCE THAT YOYRE ABOUT TO CITE TO BACK YO TOUR CLAIM IS 100% OPINION. JUST FUCKJNG SAY, “I THINK THAT.” Or “IN MY OPINION.” You’re not about to write a rigorous mathematical proof of your claim, BECAUSE ITS WRONG. You fucking idiot. You can’t make claims that are WRONG and SUVJECTIVE!!!\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly assert that every Mathlete who has ever said the phrase, “I claim that,” is a ticking SOCiALLLY INCOMPETENT IDIOT. TAKE A FUCKING CI-H class, you CARGO SHORTS VIRGIN, and learn to communicate like an ACTUAL INTELLIGENT HUMAN. The moment you claim something that’s not math the rest of the world KNOWS that you’re only capable of interacting with other mathletes (and that you’ve never talked to a girl before) and that your entire outlook on life is that of axioms and long winded stupid proofs.

Most of my friends I talk to don’t think much about politics or are just a Bernie echo chamber so I wanted to get some more opinions. Here are the most important policies for me:\n\n1. Education. I think that we don’t actually have good solutions to a lot of society’s problems, and for the problems where we do have good solutions, people won’t listen. We live in a country where 7% of people think that chocolate milk comes from brown cows and 42% of people don’t believe in evolution. How can we even expect our democracy to represent the will of the people when people don’t even know what it is they want, or how different policies will affect them? It’s embarrassing, in my opinion, that a populist such as Trump could win over the republican party without even embodying conservative values. He was just a salesmen, and millions of people bought his pitch. We need better critical reasoning skills than that if we have any chance of having a more stable government in the future and any chance of solving every other long term issue.\n2. Gun control. The point of the second amendment was to protect us against a tyrannical government, and the hundreds of millions of firearms in the country right now can’t even do that—instead they just cost us thousands of lives every year. I want much stricter gun regulation (background checks, fingerprint locks, ideally buybacks) along with an extension of other licenses that can be given out to civilians. In particular, I think it would be impossible for us to fight against the military in the slightest unless we as civilians have access to tanks, fighter jets, and SAMs, and I think that with sufficient training (maybe thousands of hours) a civilian could be taught to use these safely. Such a program would actually safe more lives than it would cost via accidents or malicious use because in the long run, with the government becoming more authoritarian and listening less and less to reasonable voters, there will likely come a point where our human rights and our democracy are at risk. And at that point, we will all be glad that some guy down the street went through the incredibly extensive background checks and safety trainings to be rolling that K1-88 tank down to capitol hill.\n3. Fiscal responsibility. I am very concerned about our nation’s deficit and debt and the long term financial impact those two will have on our children. I want a president who won’t just turn us into the next Greece.\n4. Climate change. The US (not to mention pretty much every other country in the world) will take enormous hits to health, agriculture, and their economies if climate change continuous worsening at the pace it’s at. The US contributes relatively little to this worsening (18%), so I want someone who can think bigger than just the green new deal; we need to pull in other countries (read: India and China) to start making serious changes in their climate policy, and we need to come up with serious innovations that allow us to fix the problem more than it looks like any proposed domestic policy is able to.\n\nI am genuinely curious to hear others’ opinions on these issues and which candidate you think will be best.\n\"\n","date":"Mar 3, 2020, 4:49 PM"},{"content":"1356* - Clueless first-year here, seeking advice: Is Campus Storage reputable?

Zionism describes the belief that the only Jewish state in modern history has a right to exist. It started as a reaction to the violent forms of anti-Semitism that pretty much every Jew in the western world faced on a regular basis and it only became reality when the rest of the world decided to finally stop ignoring the fact that Jews were being either systematically persecuted or popularly massacred (pre-holocaust pogroms, the holocaust, post holocaust pogroms, etc). The first inhabitants of Israel weren't religious Jews flocking to the holy land, they were refugees fleeing to pretty much the only place where they were welcome. If you disagree with how the formation of Israel was implemented or the contemporary actions of the Israeli government towards the Palestinians, I'm okay with that (in fact, I'm a Jewish Zionist and I heavily criticize the actions of Netanyahu). But if you wanna call somebody a racist for looking at history and saying that the safe haven for one of the most universally persecuted minorities had and continues to have its place in the world, then maybe take it down a notch.\"\n","date":"Mar 3, 2020, 4:48 PM"},{"content":"1344* - when does CAB release courses for next year usually\n","date":"Mar 3, 2020, 4:48 PM"},{"content":"1343* - Can someone tell me about title IX at brown?\n","date":"Mar 3, 2020, 4:48 PM"},{"content":"1342* - Keeney/Grad center/Woolley/Gregorian finally getting water stations means we suckle triple-digit-ppm-TDS water from the teat of bathroom sinks no longer, thank you UCS eom\n","date":"Mar 3, 2020, 4:47 PM"},{"content":"1341* - Not a great look for Brown Band to miss Men's Basketball Senior Night...\n","date":"Mar 3, 2020, 4:47 PM"},{"content":"1340* - can/will health services help me get medical marijuana?

This doesn't mean gun control is a bad idea - of course we should pass universal background checks, assault rifle bans, etc. But it's silly to worry about highly unlikely scenarios that you have no control over. Similarly, we should all take commonsense public health measures seriously in a time like this, but let's not panic over something that is unlikely to substantially alter our lives.

But self-centered people still think the world revolves around them and their spring break escapade.

So many low-income students have never left campus for any spring break, long weekends, or winter breaks. Usually I try not to be super negative in approaching class dynamics at Brown between students and their access to opportunities/resources/experiences, BUT this is just another example of how so many people who have the privilege to travel around the world, still act like it revolves around them.\n\nNo need to justify why or why not you're spring break trip is important/necessary.

Sorry if I’m not describing this in the correct wording but does anyone else feel this way??? It’s like people are too scared to voice ANY frustration of social life because you risk being labeled as “needy”, which seems like grounds for being completely blacklisted from a social group. Instead of people mentioning something that a friend has done that wasn’t okay, there seems to be this weird tally where people just stay silent and decide to keep track of all the mistakes, small ones at the time, until they finally let the friendship either die or cut it off in a brutal way. Not sure which one is worse if I’m being completely honest. Everyone is just so on GUARD, and one mistake that could be small and you could laugh it off turns into this weird manifestation of pruning your social tree to make sure there’s nothing volatile to upset your stability.

Not sure which stage of the investigation process you’re in but essentially any government employer granting you a clearance can and will ask if you have ever seen a mental health professional. If you tell them you have, then they will send some sort of legally binding letter to the doctor to confirm what sort of help you required, diagnoses, medications received, and do they think you are mentally sound to handle a high-stress job guarding national security. You will be asked by the doctor if they have your permission to break doctor/patient confidentiality. If you say yes, they send off the information to the government agency. If you refuse, they don’t send the information and you break the conditional offer of employment. If you have a history of suicidal ideation, thoughts of suicide, self harm, severe anger issues, frequent panic attacks, or a major mental health disorders, it is unlikely that you will be hired because of the nature of working in a cleared environment. Or they will put you on some type of probationary period if you are very lucky. That said, if you are having “temporary” or “grief-related” mental health issues in relation to a specific event (x. someone close died, horrific car accident, hazing, sexual assault), then the rules become a little grayer and they are usually more lenient with you if you stay honest. Whatever you decide to do, you should under no circumstances lie to the employer. \n\nThere are health and mental resources for you once you start at the job if needed. My advice would be to hold out until May if you can. Talk to friends or family, or peer support groups, but avoid a formalized setting of seeing a mental health professional, doctor, nurse, etc if possible. Be mindful that when you are being investigated, the employer will talk to just about anyone and everyone that knows you. \n\n!!!However!!! You should absolutely take care of your needs first and see a professional if you are having a crisis which could end with you harming yourself or others.

Engineers, teachers, nurses, therapists, scientists, etc. come to mind. I find it ironic that some people try to justify their pursuit of finance by the fact that they come from a poor family. Do you not realize that you are pursuing a career that actively works to widen the gap between the rich and poor? Do you not find it morally abhorrent that your life's work will have been making the rich richer and the poor poorer?\n\nI can admit that I also come from a poor family and have thought about finance in the past. But when there are so many other fulfilling and wholesome job prospects, I can't imagine choosing Wall Street. Now as an econ concentrator, I know that a healthy financial market is imperative to this country's long-run economic growth, prosperity, and blah blah. But our current system is deeply flawed, and I don't see many sellouts working to fix it.\n\nI'm not here to say that you're going to hell if your dream is to work on Wall Street. If that's the case, then no one can stop you! And I am also not here to say that there aren't some niche careers in finance and business that do actually make a positive impact on society. Can we please just own up to the fact that in pursuing finance, you almost always face a trade-off between a \"\"financially stable\"\" career and directly supporting a system that deeply reinforces classism?\"\n","date":"Feb 27, 2020, 1:39 PM"},{"content":"\"16769 - topics: dem nom\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.I used to think Pete was somewhat of a happy, foolproof compromise between moderate and progressive Democrats (nevertheless leaning sightly more moderate).

He was speaking about living in the present instead of the past. He was speaking about having a false nostalgia and idealized perspective of how things should be today. He was simply saying it's a different world today and we need to live in the moment and work toward a tomorrow that is based upon reality.\n\nI'm not sure everyone in America or Brown gets that context. Sometimes I worry about the overall intellectual ability of the average person to process complicated messages which aren't just dog-whistle politics, dummified slogans, or simplistic propaganda. The reverse of what he was saying (MAGA or \"\"Our Revolution\"\") is much easier for the average person to understand but it's also smoke and mirrors.\n\nAlso, Pete is such a Stoic.

I don’t expect it to be completely silent—even though it really should be, there are so many places people can go to have conversations other than here—but they have literally been speaking at full volume for ten minutes! What can I do?\nAlso, a plea to anyone who has ever done this or considered it: if you have to work on a group project or want to talk to your friends about literally anything, go to a group study space!

How many of you clicked the link and looked at the building (which looks fine), thinking it’s the same one being discussed? The picture is of a residence hall at Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA.\nIf you don’t like the look of that one, here are other Deborah Berkes that I think are even prettier:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B811nq2JAEP/\nhttps://www.dberke.com/work/248-princeton-university-residential-colleges\ncollegeshttps://www.dberke.com/work/244-lewis-international-law-center-harvard-law-school\nThough the post was very misleading, I don’t think that was intentional.\n\nHowever, even if this were the proposed dorm, I would be ecstatic about its Platinum LEED certification. Brown (unlike some other Ivies) hasn’t yet built or retrofitted a single one of its buildings to earn this badge of sustainability. As it stands, the actual proposed dorm is planned to live up to only Silver LEED standards.\nhttps://www.brown.edu/sustainability/initiatives/building-design-construction-leed\n\nSetting aside the alleged ugliness of Dickinson College, other students voiced more legitimate concerns about the displacement of local businesses, particularly of Bagel Gourmet and Mini Mart (whose presence, as a nearby resident, I will deeply miss).\n\n\"\"1152* - ...I propose we pour our righteous indignation into getting Brown to include ground-floor commercial space in the new dorm building... Local businesses students love *and* new student housing is better than either one alone\"\"\n\nThis seems to already be in the works. According to the University release on the 18th, “part of the cost will also be covered by renting out the ground floor (approximately 2500 square feet) as retail space.” Brown is supporting the businesses for relocation, and will obviously pay for the purchase and demolishing of the existing structures. https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/02/19/brown-announces-new-residence-hall-plan/?fbclid=IwAR07ZCP4p-8vqXcf-tmV1302iHAml8FgDwuTdp6Zz_6SARGns0V5nRsO0kA\n\nAll of the facts that I’ve laid out so far require minimal research and a thumb’s-scroll down from a knee-jerk reaction to a DB link. I myself am guilty for mistaking the picture as the proposal at first glance.\n\nBut the reason why I write this post is to hopefully dispel what I see as a concerning reactionary trend among my fellow progressives, exemplified by this DB commenter:\n\n~“The problem with capitalism is this. This. We really need to support small businesses rather than let large private entities like Brown do whatever they want”~\n\nWell-meaning people who are constantly inundated in valid critiques of our status quo’s systemic issues begin to misinterpret the objective of progressivism not as social reform, but as an immediate opposition to any proposal with so much as a whiff of what they think is capitalism. A surface-level reading of the situation will motivate your reasoning:\nBrown + Money -> Capitalism Bad >:( -> Dorm Ugly!!\nMost shocking is to hear my ACABer friends cry over the displacement - not removal, displacement - of a **police station** and its parking lot.\n\nBut understanding the actual side effects of housing construction will elicit support from those who have more than name-only solidarity with the people with the least power in this situation. \n\nI watch people who decry the displacing effects of gentrification and rage at landlords on social media turn on a dime at the slightest mention of Big Bad Brown Corp. and vehemently oppose the construction of a building that would directly combat the phenomenon they despise.\nWhose financial interests do you stand behind when you oppose housing construction?\nRich local landowners. They’re with you on the Facebook picket line.\n\nImagine mocking a (different) building that represents an attempt to -h-o-u-s-e- “efficiently store” -s-t-u-d-e-n-t-s- “property” as “dystopic” at a school that hasn’t built a place for its students to live in about three decades.\nIf what it took to stop climate change and gentrification was for us to live in Platinum LEED glorified container ship crates, would you be able to stomach it?\nIf you have concerns about the proposal because of “overenrollment,” ask yourself this: what attendance trend is this dorm specifically designed to address directly?\n\nWhich should Brown take into more consideration?\nA) College Hill landlord financial interests and your aesthetic disapproval of a building that you haven't seen, and - unless you’re a freshman - will not be completed while you're here and that you will likely never set foot in? \nOr\nB) the permanent creation of quality student housing with direct access to businesses on their bottom floor that eases the financial burden on graduate students and low-income community members by removing hundreds of wealthy, elite, largely white students armed with their parents' money from the renting market?\n\nAsk yourself that question the next time you briskly walk past a homeless person on Thayer.\"\nUpdated Feb 25, 2020, 1:34 PM\n","date":"Feb 25, 2020, 1:34 PM"},{"content":"1201* - Funny how nobody's talking about what's going to happen to the Providence Police Station between the Mini Mart and the Bagel Gourmet...suspicious\n","date":"Feb 25, 2020, 1:32 PM"},{"content":"1200* - i can't tell if I'm learning anything in making decisions or not lmao\n","date":"Feb 25, 2020, 1:32 PM"},{"content":"1199* - does ratty just randomly put as many country or region names/words for ethnic food as possible in the menu titles to make it sound like dining services provide for all nationalities present on campus?\n","date":"Feb 25, 2020, 1:32 PM"},{"content":"\"1198* - Hi ladies, it is your lover.\nLet's talk about body hair.

I agree with everything you said about not generalizing, just because you’re a legacy doesn’t mean you didn’t work hard, etc. Your feelings are totally valid BUT here is something you need to recognize: all of the things you used as examples of how hard you worked to get in here are so inherently privileged. Going to a school that offers AP classes? Or things you can compete in at a national level? Having time to be the president of multiple clubs because you didn’t have to work to support your family? MULTIPLE internships??? All of those opportunities you had were (most likely) at least loosely tied to whatever success your mom had after graduating from brown. I don’t fault you for taking advantage of them because you can’t control the life you’re born into so you should take advantage of whatever you’ve got, but you should also recognize that some people here didn’t have any of those opportunities, and that’s why a lot of non-legacy students feel so strongly about admissions processes that favor legacies in any way—legacies (in general) already have such a huge advantage over non-legacies, so why should they be given any more?\n","date":"Feb 25, 2020, 1:15 PM"},{"content":"1169* - nOt eVeRy lEgAcY KiD GeTs iN BeCaUsE ThEy aRe lEgAcY. sOmE LeGaCy jUsT HaPpEn tO HaVe hAd pArEnTs wHo wEnT To bRoWn aNd sEpArAtElY LiKeD ThE ScHoOl.

If they did not, nobody would pay them to do that work. Market forces will drive their wage to be as low as possible. Because of this, over layers of employment, wealth is always funneled up. In this system, we expect those at the top to have obscenely more wealth than everyone at the bottom. The more people there are in a nation, the lower we expect wages to be, and the higher we expect the accumulated wealth of those at the top to be. This is quite obviously the case, in the USA.\n\nIn some ways, this is good. It means people are working hard, and the economy is efficient. If those at the top are competent, they can placate the masses with all their excessive wealth. They can take whatever good fortune they had to end up at the top and fund whatever project or luxury they want, as long as everyone below them is happy enough with their lives that they don't mind.\n\nBut this is not the case in the US. Those at the top are overwhelmingly stupid, and abusive. Instead of trying to generate more wealth overall, they resort to stripping away anything they can from the most vulnerable people. They make living more expensive, working less rewarding, and education less accessible, because they would rather the wealth of an unhealthy population rather than the labor of a motivated powerful population. They look at climate change and choose a future of paying to mitigate its damages for a present of scavenging just a little more profit.\n\nThey could have given everyone healthcare, invested in sustainable energy practices, and subsidized college so the laborers would be smart enough to generate even more wealth, and happy enough to let them live like kings. They could have placated the working class like they did the moderate middle class, who feel comfortable enough with their current lives that they resist any change.\n\nInstead, the working class is abused, the climate is hostile, and China is on track to economically surpassing a country that had a 5 decade lead in technology, education, and infrastructure. The ruling class of the US is an embarrassment. They have proven unfit for the power they wield. Their power and hubris suppresses those who are better fit to organize and lead the country.

There are not 60 votes in the Senate to ban the private health insurance you got in your union negotiations, nor will there be after the election. You're gonna be okay.\n\nJust because campaigns have goals and aspirations -- and both Warren and Sanders have proposed banning private insurance in their first terms -- doesn't mean it's going to happen immediately, and it doesn't mean those aspirations are lies.\n\nIt's about having a fight that polarizes the electorate around a particular value--in this case, people's health care over profit, and it's about showing a willingness to fight. That fight is unlikely to lead to 100% of the M4A bill as written. \n\nThe bottom line is that if you like Sanders or Warren and are a culinary worker being fearmongered by your union boss about your private health care, you should not be afraid you're going to lose it, and vote your gut.”\n\nFellas:\n\nDo you support Bernie because:\n\n-he is a realistic pragmatist who won’t implement his flagship policy “in his first term” but electing him should show a “willingness to fight”? Yes We Can Try?\n\nOr \n-You think the policies he’s running on will actually get passed despite a Senate stuck in the 50-Dem area (some of whom are named Manchin, Sinema, and Jones)?\n\nIs talking about the effects of a candidate’s proposed policies “fearmongering” because we shouldn’t worry about outcomes; after all, the candidate won’t actually implement their campaign promises?\n\nOr do working people have legitimate concerns about losing hard-fought health care concessions from corporations to an untested centralized system that could be completely defunded by the next Republican Congress?\n\nUnion members get “don’t worry nothing will change” and the rest of us get “death to landlords, the revolution is coming”\n\nWhich is it?\"\n","date":"Feb 13, 2020, 11:34 PM"},{"content":"\"1001* - People here tend to feel that going to a more competitive and well-funded high school is much more advantageous than going to a less competitive high school, but as a graduate of a not so competitive high school, I just couldn’t help but feel that I would not be where I am today had I gone to a more competitive high school that some of my middle school friends went to. Because my high school was much less competitive, I was able to focus more time doing extracurricular since getting A’s in my classes were just so much easier. Also, getting into academic-based clubs (I.e. science Olympiad), getting leadership positions in those clubs, and standing out to teachers (and thus getting better LORs) were all much easier at my high school. Because I went to a worse high school than my friend, I was able to build a much stronger college application, which allowed me to get into Brown and enjoy the wonderful opportunities Brown offers.

But basically for some reason, there were ride-able, flying beasts (I think there were only equines and dragons, but I don't quite remember). They were arranged in order of increasingly awesome sneeze. I had to pick one to ride. I don't remember very much about the first few beasts, besides one horse who had a very clean sneeze that didn't spray mucus or saliva even a little bit, and I thought \"\"Nice!\"\" But I have a clear memory of the last 4. \n\nThe first three of those were either dragons or wyverns (I believe I called them dragons at the time, but I am fairly sure they were two-legged, thus wyverns). The fourth-to-last beast was undead, mostly made of bones, yet tame, friendly if proud, and would have been easily ridden. Its sneeze was remarkable primarily for its very ability to sneeze (it lacking lungs, a throat, and a mouth). \n\nThe third-to-last beast was a great red wyvern, and when it sneezed, flame burst forth from its scales over its entire body. \"\"This is a truly remarkable sneeze!\"\" I thought.\n\nThe second-to-last beast was a golden wyvern, even larger than the last. When it sneezed, a column of flame burst from its mouth, and the room expanded to show me that the column didn't decrease in intensity for 100 meters! \"\"Truly an astounding sneeze!\"\" I though. What beast could top this?\"\"\n\nThe final beast was a fat brown narrow-mouthed cartoon horse named Bob. At first, Bob refused to sneeze. After much cajoling on my part, he still refused to sneeze. Eventually, I put two fingers on his jaw to move it in a mimic of a sneeze, and the horse let out a quiet, non-nonchalant \"\"ah-chu.\"\"\n\nFor some reason, it was immediately apparent to me that this had easily been the best sneeze of all, and that this was the beast I must ride.\n\nThe horse and I exited through a window like our dorm windows, through the 40 cm space between the bar and the sill, yet for some reason this was not a difficult task.\n\nI then realized the ridiculousness of the situation. I had exited via the window a room which had not been my own, and I was now hanging out of my dorm window, straddling a wingless, supposedly flying horse named Bob.\n\nI deduced that there were two possibilities\n1. I had been given some sort of powerful hallucinogen, and I was now hanging out of my window, convinced that if I let go, an imaginary wingless horse would fly me to safety\n2. I was dreaming\n\nIf I were hallucinating and I let go, then I would surely die.\n\nAs soon as the thought entered my mind that the horse was imaginary, it disappeared.\n\nI attempted to pull myself up on the bar, to see if I could climb bck in. I realized I could do so much more easily than I could in real life, and so concluded it must be a dream.\n\nAs I was deciding what to do now that I was in the midst of a lucid dream, my alarm sounded.\"\n","date":"Feb 13, 2020, 11:29 PM"},{"content":"981* - do you need to do textbook readings for clps 0900 tests?\n","date":"Feb 13, 2020, 11:29 PM"},{"content":"980* - Third week of school and we have hit the point of crying most of the day ✌️ Hopefully it's uphill from here cuz otherwise maybe I just won't graduate\n","date":"Feb 13, 2020, 11:29 PM"},{"content":"979* - Gatsby believed in the green crane, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.

Saying this because for black/latinx/native, etc, students, that's often the area where there's minority programs meant to help underrepresented groups. And I've heard Asian students in the past complaining that they also aren't included as part of the \"under represented groups\"). Not saying y'all don't face racism, and I genuinely feel for all my fellow POC because it's rough to exist in a world of white privilege when you're non-white in any sort of way. But let black and latinx students have programs meant to help alleviate their specific brand of racism without insinuating you deserve to be a part of it too. Also, \"institutional privilege\" is such a sus thing to say... it's like claiming that other racial minorities are privileged or actually have it better than everyone else because these programs exist, when the truth is that we face institutional RACISM, and have it pretty damn bad- and THAT is why the programs exist.\n","date":"Feb 13, 2020, 11:28 PM"},{"content":"974* - how important for an A are the readings for HIAA 0860 contemporary architecture?

It is the system that is the problem. An article can be easily shut down if a higher-up wants it to be, and that’s what happened with the women’s basketball article. The athletic department and the coach were made aware of the article and stopped it. It is not the BDH’s fault. So, to make this quick:\n\n1. Coach Sarah Behn is an extremely emotionally abusive woman. In her time here, more than 14 women have quit the basketball team (pre, post, and mid-season).\n2. She’s racist (has made inappropriate comments about a woman on an opposing basketball team kneeling during the anthem as well as many other culturally inappropriate remarks)\n3. She constantly violated FERPA (speaking to parents without the player’s consent) and shared information about players to their parents that were either inappropriate, false or defaming.\n4. She emotionally manipulated players into sharing their personal life/struggles with her and then proceeded to use it against them in abusive ways (For example, had a sports psychologist join the team who did not keep the information that was shared with her confidential)\n5. Continually shamed women about their weight by connecting their performance on the court with their weight, which caused some women to adopt unhealthy habits in hopes of losing weight and gain favor to play.\n6. Shamed players for taking their schoolwork more seriously than basketball or not holding a basketball at a “high enough” pedestal. \n7. Encouraged divisive chemistry between players on the team \n8. In some cases, she was extremely disrespectful and rude to players' families that were not “favored” on the team.\n\nOverall, the program is an extremely toxic environment, and the athletic department thought it was okay to take away the voices of many women who were hurt. That’s what happened. \n\n\"\n","date":"Feb 13, 2020, 11:20 PM"},{"content":"16258 - When you’re in love with him but he’s just a piece of art 😩 love you Blueno 😩\n","date":"Feb 13, 2020, 11:20 PM"},{"content":"16257 - friends who go to the gym together are SO CUTE\n","date":"Feb 13, 2020, 11:20 PM"},{"content":"16256 - Are the stacks in the Rock an official/unofficial quiet space?

I have seen multiple posts on social media about university students' fear of Chinese folks or concerns over getting in touch with them. Even worse, a man showing the mud on his sole, pointing to it and saying 'China' to a Chinese student around Harvard. These trigger counterposts by ethnic Chinese, or more often in my circle, Chinese students feeling defensive and insecure about the racist or quasi-racist surroundings they happened to be in.\n\nTwo comments I want to make about the phenomenon. First, when people have concerns over specialised health issue such as the coronavirus, the best source of advice to address such apprehension, is a professional medical practitioner rather than a social media tunnel, no matter how easily accessible or emotionally comforting it is. You need to believe in science. You need to jump out of your own box and try to overcome your own sentiment and think, what that matter really is.\nSecond, I strongly doubt the role elite universities play in the whole affair. At this moment of disease crisis, public apprehension and xenophobia, the university health service system should intervene more strongly and more professionally in providing reliable information about the virus and proper sanitary measures (such as careful washing of one's own hands or more frequent use of 75% alcohol on door knobs, etc.), in sootheing the apprehension of its students, and in executing proper quarantine. Some prestigious universities or colleges in the New York state, according to some grumpy posts of quarantined Chinese students, are executing the quarantine measure in a more or less careless and performative way. Their staff would call to a student's room in the dormitory and reprimand the person not to leave when the phone was not picked up last time. But - people need to go to the restroom, they need to shower, and they need to get themselves necessary supplies that have not been sent directly to their rooms. Thus precautionary quarantine and observation need to be executed professionally and of course, as you mentioned in our interview, mental health service would do good. Thus, the university authority, I have to say, has not acted as professionally as one might have desired.\n\nEthnic identity is a divisive issue in the US, just as the Cultural Revolution and 1989 are in China. But I am not presenting the solution from an ethnic perspective, which is quite popular among liberals nowadays. Surely I know some will dismiss those ideas as postmodern rubbish, though I do find them meaningful and useful. However, as a student of European history, I believe there are wiser ways, more universal ways than playing the ethnic card to address this xenophobia/(quasi-)racism problem. That's the moral lesson of Enlightenment philosphers: be alert at one's own sentiment, esp. pride and prejudice; always have curiosity about and awe towards science; as for institutions - handle social issues and policy making on campus in a professional way rather than fumbling like the French court on the eve of the revolution. This is why I really want to recommend Peter Gay's magnus opus to readers of this post: Peter Gay, The Enlightenment: An Interpretation, 2 vols. (pbk., New York, NY: W. W. Norton, 1977). Every sociey has its modern witch craze, so does the Chinese one. But here for the American society, looking at the intersection of coronavirus and race, if I am allowed to say a word than being censored, it goes as follows: if one gives way to fear rather than using such an occasion to learn a bit more about health and medicine, and worse, if one simply lets fear marry his or her own sense of ethnic superiority, this is even less so about 'orientalism'; this is really about forgetting the wisdom of his or her great great great grandfathers who opened a new page in European history and gave birth to this country.\"\n","date":"Feb 10, 2020, 5:02 PM"},{"content":"16208 - cowonaviwus uwu\n","date":"Feb 10, 2020, 5:01 PM"},{"content":"16207 - Painted Ladies... dont you mean women of color?\n","date":"Feb 10, 2020, 5:00 PM"},{"content":"16206 - when you’re in love with him but he’s with her. :,(\n","date":"Feb 10, 2020, 5:00 PM"},{"content":"16205 - I peed on you today\n","date":"Feb 10, 2020, 5:00 PM"},{"content":"16204 - Ugh, we live in a society :(\n","date":"Feb 10, 2020, 5:00 PM"},{"content":"16203 - i literally don't understand how someone can send anybody else death threats or say mean things anonymously??? like fam chill\n","date":"Feb 10, 2020, 5:00 PM"},{"content":"16202 - using t as a variable in math fills me with absolute RAGE!

And yes they all happened to be the same race, and all I could think in my head was, \"Fuck, do they think I'm being racist? Because they're being obnoxious and there's nothing wrong with me wanting to avoid them.\" Or someone said on here something along the lines of, \"I coughed, and the person next to me saw that I was Chinese, so they moved away from me, and that's racist.\" ...No? If I had extra room around me, and *literally anyone* coughed next to me, I wouldn't wanna get sick. I get sick a lot. I would move father away. I don't care what your race is. But now, I can't help but feel bad for those actions. Like I feel inclined to *not* do those harmless actions just because someone might think I'm being racist.

He was the greatest sports role model of all time in that he embodied all the principles and attributes of such.\n\nThere is a reason why so many people have been devastated. Emotionally wrecked to the point where they cannot function. Basketball players across the nation, many of whom have grown up through unimaginable circumstances, are seen sobbing in the middle of games. Many have had to sit out for several days because they are not emotionally stable enough to play or practice. They just want to mourn. Even foreign athletes, including soccer and tennis players, have been seen heartbroken and paying their respects to Kobe. Reporters, coaches, talk show hosts, anyone who was able to have meaningful conversations with him have been in tears on national television.\n\nBut on Dear Blueno, the majority of posts that I see are about Kobe’s sexual assault case, and the inability to understand why his death means so much more than those struggling in third world countries. Before delving into this, Kobe without a doubt made a severe mistake by putting the woman in an uncomfortable situation. And if this had happened during the Me Too movement, the consequences may have been different. His actions were unacceptable. \n\nHowever, if you do even the slightest bit of research you can see that the case was a lot less black and white. The victim chose not to testify in court, even though she did not receive any compensation/bribes from Kobe or his lawyers. I don’t want to extrapolate on what this may mean, but there is a lot that can be implied from this. Also to be acknowledged is that the victim was a frequent consumer of hard drugs and had a few failed suicide attempts. This is not to denounce her credibility, but to shed light onto the fact that her mental state may have led to miscommunication. Aside from this, Kobe was relatively quick to apologize and expressed genuine regret for putting the victim and her family through such painful times. He believed the encounter was consensual. Ultimately, the case was settled privately. In such matters, we (including myself) are quick to side with the victim and sympathize with them. However, it isn’t right to determine Kobe’s legacy based on a crime he was not charged for.\n\nWhile the case will forever be tied to his name, there are a multitude of reasons why his legacy is so great. As an 18 year old coming straight out of high school, Kobe came straight for Michael Jordan’s unanimous title as the greatest basketball player of all time. Everyone thought he was crazy. But for 20 years, he remained loyal to his Lakers while waking up daily at 3am to practice 3-4 times a day regardless of whether he was in season or off season. All that determination led to countless awards and he became the pride of Los Angeles. He was living proof that with hard work, anything was achievable.\n\nOff the court, he stressed the importance of paying things forward. He famously said that if he is remembered only as being a great basketball player, he has failed in life. Kobe stressed paying things forward to the new generation, and making things better for his children. He has advocated endlessly for women’s rights, especially in the WNBA and NCAA women’s basketball. In recent years, he has shown men around the world how to be a loving husband and a “girl dad.” As an intellectual who could fluently speak five plus languages, Kobe inspired minorities around the world to fall in love with basketball and connected with them through their dialect. He was a storyteller, winning an Oscar and writing a children’s book series. He was what every athlete should strive to be: a winner and a philanthropist. \n\nKobe had so much more planned to accomplish, things that would benefit humanity and inspire the next generation. To me, and a large population of people especially from Southern California, Kobe’s death hits especially hard. Aside from family and close friends, he would be the last person we would want to lose. We feel like his life was cut too short, not to mention the lives of all the others on the plane including his daughter Gigi. This past week has been emotionally taxing for me and has been the most unproductive week of my life. You can say that I’m weak for feeling that way, but I argue that it just shows how much Kobe meant for the people. \n\nI know it’s hard to truly know how others feel. That’s fine, but please try to be more understanding because a lot of people around you may be feeling the same way as I do. If I’ve somehow motivated you to learn more about Kobe and his principles, I’d suggest going to YouTube since endless numbers of people have been sharing touching stories about his kind heart and competitive nature.\n\n“Kobe was as synonymous with Southern California as the sunshine. He touched every inch of it.”\"\n","date":"Feb 5, 2020, 7:50 PM"},{"content":"16034 - based on previous years, does computer vision have a strict cutoff for an A (a strict 90)?\n","date":"Feb 5, 2020, 7:50 PM"},{"content":"16033 - i really like you and i’m going to tell you tonight. i hope you like me too!\n","date":"Feb 5, 2020, 7:50 PM"},{"content":"16032 - People looking for an easy forth class: why don't you just take three classes?\n","date":"Feb 5, 2020, 7:49 PM"},{"content":"16031 - I think my roommate is a socialist.

Let's just say my symptoms were due to an allergic reaction to something but she said that what I was telling her could not be anything but pneumonia, probably associated with the Coronavirus, and that I needed to alert the hospital immediately, implying they should take precautions, and submit myself for evaluation. \n\nMeanwhile here I was sitting there thinking that one of the Brown Health Services nurses could offer up alternatives to Benadryl to help curb my allergies, since Benadryl makes me drowsy and non functional the next day. \n\nAfter that little... experience.. I ended up just biting the bullet and taking some Benadryl that finally allowed me to fall asleep. Lucky to announce that not only do I not have a cough, fever, or anything else indicative of pneumonia ( I had both bacterial and viral pneumonia before, so I think I would know my own body), but am now dreading going to Health Services for even a scratch because I'm legit afraid the nurse from last night is going to try to quarantine me.\n\nI've had my fair share of racist comments throughout my life, and I know Chinese people are known to turn the other cheek when it comes to public conflict. But honestly, that's the values that came from my parents' generation and I don't intend to abide by them. \n\nI'm sick of the closeted xenophobia that some Americans mindlessly project, and that's coming from me, an American myself. I felt that hard last night ( aka early this morning)- like \"\" oh honey you and your kind are RUINING IT for everybody else. \"\" \"\" America first, but only the fully westernized Americans.\"\" \n\nJust because an epidemic happened to come out of a government's negligence in communication and public sanitation, doesn't mean that is a reflection of anything but another country's grim state of affairs. It doesn't give you a license to be a dick to Chinese people.\n\nIf something broke out in France, would people with ties to France also be subject to this treatment? Don't quite know the answer, but this should never happen, no matter where that something horrible originated from, regardless if the main people affected are white, black, Latinx, Native American, Asian, or any other race. \n\nI've never felt so put into a box, and I can't believe that out of all the places that this could happen, it would be on the Brown campus. And I grew up in a pretty racist town. I want Brown Health Services to be held accountable for their actions. \"\n","date":"Feb 3, 2020, 8:01 PM"},{"content":"835* - The only one blowin up my dms is my battery telling me it's dying\n","date":"Feb 3, 2020, 8:01 PM"},{"content":"834* - odd ivy league insecurity but I feel imposter-y bc I wasn’t my high school valedictorian it doesn’t come up in conversation or anything but so many ppl here were that I just feel weird about it\n","date":"Feb 3, 2020, 8:01 PM"},{"content":"\"833* - I came out to my (asian, conservative, based in southern USA) parents as bi over winter break and it did not go well.

Yet, those exact same people are the ones who are working on internships without telling other people and building their resume... They tell me to stop worrying as if I'm a competition they are trying to get rid of.\n\nOn top of academic and resume building work, there is the social aspect which I also suck at. Just stepping into a 'social' event and realizing everybody else has their own circles and bubbles going with no space for me to awkwardly join in. Furthermore, the standards for females at brown is ridiculously high. People here are all gorgeous, smart, sociable, and radiates greatness. I tried to hit the gym and improve my fits but again, there is a voice telling me that I should be studying instead and just accept my place in society: a blur in the background. \n\nAnd then there are people who seem to be enjoying themselves, hanging out with people and attending parties and such. They seem live so freely away from the pressure of being at a place at Brown. I feel immensely grateful to be here to the point where if I am not understanding classes or feel like I am 'taking a break from studying,' I am not utilizing the resource I have given.

We were both deeply involved in social justice projects. That especially really breaks my heart.\nThis person doesn't have an excuse to be ignorant. She has all the freedoms Uighurs don't, and access to an education that even most Americans couldn't afford.\nI come from a family of refugees from two different ethnic genocides. I'm an American. They immigrated to the US for a reason - they knew they would be safe, and they knew they could give their children a better life. We, their descendants, now have more power than almost anyone in society, and this is what we do with it?\n\nTo see someone who used to stand up for marginalized communities actively participating in the TEXTBOOK DEFINITION of SYSTEMIC ERASURE by an Han supremacist state makes me depressed and numb. Since when is this being an ally? Does Islamophobia only matter when white people are the oppressors?\n\nSince when did being further left become more important than fighting for social justice? \nThe transformation I've seen in the past few year in friends from home is radical. Once, I marched with these people at the Women's March, climate marches, against the travel ban and for #BlackLivesMatter. Now, they say that we need to dismantle capitalism completely, that feminism is \"\"neoliberal\"\", and they stan authoritarian, dictatorial regimes like China or Venezuela that are socialist in name only, just to own the libs.\n\nPlease, friends and tankies. The lives and rights of millions of people across the globe should not be treated like pawns in your culture war, tossed aside when they become inconvenient to your narrative. The camps in Xinjiang should not be a partisan issue, especially for people with the privilege of your education. My great-grandfather was taken to a camp, too. The absolute least you can do is acknowledge that it happened. And the next tiny step up from that is to promise that it won't ever happen again.\"\n","date":"Jan 28, 2020, 9:09 PM"},{"content":"739* - anyone know if you can somehow change the grade option (ABC or SNC) after the deadline has passed? are there really no exceptions?\n","date":"Jan 28, 2020, 9:09 PM"},{"content":"738* - The biomed building can go fuck itself\n","date":"Jan 28, 2020, 9:09 PM"},{"content":"737* - @15635 The Ivy Room is not vegan- it’s vegetarian.

I can only assume he had just eaten some type of curry, which reacted with the mayonnaise and Ranch dressing in his white stomach to create one of the most foul and multicultural odors I have ever smelled. I cannot emphasize enough that this man imperialized my nostrils with a Nina, a Pinta and a Santa Maria of sulfur. I immediately rose to my feet and rushed to the dank Refectory bathroom, where the contents of my stomach violently erupted just moments after I reached the toilet bowl. The chunks of my former naanwich floated despondently in the water as I continued dry heaving for minutes on end, soggy reminders of my now wasted meal credit. Now, I haven’t eaten in days. I can’t keep a single bite of even the blandest foods down, and I’m beginning to panic. Who do I talk to? Health services? Title IX? DPS? I feel like my olfactory bulb and my intestinal lining have been violated, and I can’t cleanse myself of this Caucasian impurity. However, I must admit to something: I’m extremely aroused. Persistently ever since. There is something so carnal and animalistic about marking your territory like that. I fear that I’m allowing my libido to be colonized, and for this reason I’m doubly nauseated. All I know is that the Ivy Room is forever spoiled for me, as returning will no doubt result in alternating waves of visceral disgust and orgasmic pleasure.

Third, there’s infinite things to learn about the game, and you never stop learning new things. Fourth, When you play competitively, you win non-transferable, nonrefundable and non-redeemable points called masterpoints, And even though I’m a super frugal guy, I happily fork over money for the chance to win these points. But wait there’s more. You don’t need to pay to play, come to Brown’s Bridge club, where we have wonderful players who have super fun times playing a card game that is just as good shitfaced as sober, And that makes you Feel at times like a genius and it times like a doofus.

Birthright is funded by a combination of the Israeli government and Jewish donors like Sheldon Anderson.\n\nYou seem to misunderstand the concept of reparations. The idea is that the group or institution responsible should pay for the harm they've done: hence why we talk about reparations for African Americans coming from the US Federal government (due to its long history of harming them).\n\nHow would Birthright then be a form of reparations? The people directly paying for it monetarily are Jews, while the harm of it everyone is debating is felt by Palestinians (who are indeed victims of colonialism). If either cost of Birthright were paid for by Europeans, your argument would make a little sense, but instead it's just harming other oppressed groups. No one's asking Native Americans to foot the bill for reparations to African Americans.\n\nYou seem instead to think that being part of an oppressed group makes it okay to do harm to others. Some of the original proposals for a Jewish state were in Native American lands or south Africa. Would it be justified to colonize and displace those peoples, just because of oppression Jews suffered all the way over in Europe?\n\nNot only does your post diminish the suffering of Palestinians and the ways in which Birthright is complicit in it, but you also twist the idea of reparations into something it's not supposed to mean. There are people in this country fighting for reparations right now as a result of direct injustice against identities you don't hold.

There had been no Likud governments, no invasions of Lebanon, no Intifadas (the first of which was directly inspired by King), and Israel had not just considered a constitutional amendment to legalize segregation. \n\nKing never spoke on the issue of Palestinian refugees, so it's kind of hard to reconstruct what his views would have been based on his few direct comments on the issue. But we can look to his values, as Michelle Alexander does in her NYT piece, \"\"Time to Break the Silence on Palestine\"\" (which someone else linked to in the original thread):\n\n“And so, if we are to honor King’s message and not merely the man, we must condemn Israel’s actions: unrelenting violations of international law, continued occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza, home demolitions and land confiscations. We must cry out at the treatment of Palestinians at checkpoints, the routine searches of their homes and restrictions on their movements, and the severely limited access to decent housing, schools, food, hospitals and water that many of them face…\n\nOf course, there will be those who say that we can’t know for sure what King would do or think regarding Israel-Palestine today. That is true. The evidence regarding King’s views on Israel is complicated and contradictory.\n\nUltimately, King canceled a pilgrimage to Israel in 1967 after Israel captured the West Bank. During a phone call about the visit with his advisers, he said, ‘I just think that if I go, the Arab world, and of course Africa and Asia for that matter, would interpret this as endorsing everything that Israel has done, and I do have questions of doubt.’”\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/opinion/sunday/martin-luther-king-palestine-israel.html\n\nEither way, we have seen what the Israeli government does to nonviolent activists like King: Mubarak Awad, founder of the Palestinian Centre for the Study of Nonviolence, was deported from his birthplace of Jerusalem, something not even George Wallace or Lester Maddox had the gall to attempt. Like Alexander, I am willing to bet that if King had lived to witness the First Intifada—when nonviolent Palestinian protesters were beaten under Yitzhak Rabin's order to \"\"break their bones\"\"—or if he were alive today to see Palestinian protesters in Gaza be mowed down by snipers, he would not have condoned the perpetrators (as your quote about \"\"security\"\" suggests). \n\nIt's frustrating every MLK day to see white people try to reinvent King as some kind of black puppet conveniently condoning their own reactionary views, now that he’s no longer alive to defend himself. King was a proud radical; he was hated by most white people as a radical; and he was killed just two weeks after that quote of yours for being a radical. If you actually want to honor his memory, you should start by reexamining some of your own views on justice—like why you’re on the side against justice for Palestinians. \n\n\"\nUpdated Jan 23, 2020, 2:27 PM\n","date":"Jan 23, 2020, 2:27 PM"},{"content":"15487 - difference between clps 200 human cognition and clps 400 cognitive neuroscience? which one is easier or harder and would anyone recommend one over the other for a first year?\n","date":"Jan 23, 2020, 2:27 PM"},{"content":"15486 - How can I find a professor /develop a relationship with them to ask for a letter of recommendation for law school?

Shouldn't we believe all women?\"\" What I'm about to say will certainly be misinterpreted at first, but hear me out: no, we should not believe all women. We shouldn't believe all men, either. We should form our beliefs and political positions based on a thorough examination of the evidence being put forth, past and present. The phrase was coined in response to Blasey Ford's testimony. I believe her. But not because she is a woman. I believe her because her testimony and the evidence presented for her case read, to me, as credible. In Warren's case, however, the accusation and context are obviously and entirely different. Given Bernie's stated positions and track record advocating for women candidates and issues concerning women, does it seem to make any sense at all that he would even entertain such an idea, that a woman couldn't be president? And doesn't that accusation fit Warren's political agenda to win the primary she's losing a little too snugly? And isn't the timing (reviving an unconfirmed, alleged statement a year after it was made) three weeks out from the Iowa caucus, even the slightest bit suspicious to you? Maybe it's time progressives separated their fetish for identity politics from their platform and recognize that holding a marginalized identity does not automatically make someone, or their actions, the epitome of honesty and virtue. \"\n","date":"Jan 18, 2020, 1:24 PM"},{"content":"582* - Hi!

Then I accept. Children are not the property of the state; everyone who wishes to do so has the right to offer educational goods or services at a fair market rate. Let us leave at once.”\n\n“Malfoy bought the whole team brand-new Nimbus Cleansweeps!” Ron said, like a poor person. “That’s not fair!”\n\n“Everything that is possible is fair,” Harry reminded him gently. “If he is able to purchase better equipment, that is his right as an individual. How is Draco’s superior purchasing ability qualitatively different from my superior Snitch-catching ability?”\n\n“I guess it isn’t,” Ron said crossly.\n\nHarry laughed, cool and remote, like if a mountain were to laugh. “Someday you’ll understand, Ron.”\n\nProfessor Snape stood at the front of the room, his beak-like nose protruding over the silent classroom. “There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don’t expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few who possess, the predisposition…I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death.”\n\nHarry’s hand shot up.\n\n“What is it, Potter?” Snape asked, irritated.\n\n“What’s the value of these potions on the open market?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Why are you teaching children how to make these valuable products for ourselves at a schoolteacher’s salary instead of creating products to meet modern demand?”\n\n“You impertinent boy–“\n\n“Conversely, what’s to stop me from selling these potions myself after you teach us how to master them?”\n\n“I–“\n\n“This is really more of a question for the Economics of Potion-Making, I guess. What time are econ lessons here?”\n\n“We have no economics lessons in this school, you ridiculous boy.”\n\nHarry Potter stood up bravely. “We do now. Come with me if you want to learn about market forces!”\n\nThe students poured into the hallway after him. They had a leader at last. Dumbledore's army of economic analysts had been founded.\n\nHarry and Ron stood before the Mirror of Erised. “My God,” Ron said. “Harry, it’s your dead parents.”\n\nHarry’s eyes flicked momentarily over to the mirror. “So it is. This information is neither useful nor productive. Let us leave at once, to assist Hagrid in his noble enterprise of raising as many dragon eggs as he sees fit, in spite of our country’s unjust dragon-trading restrictions.”\n\n“But it’s your parents, Harry,” Ron said. Ron never really got it.\n\nHarry sighed. “The fundamental standard for all relationships is the trader principle, Ron.”\n\n“I don’t understand,” Ron said.\n\n“Of course you don’t,” said Harry affectionately. “This principle holds that we should interact with people on the basis of the values we can trade with them – values of all sorts, including common interests in art, sports or music, similar philosophical outlooks, political beliefs, sense of life, and more. Dead people have no value according to the trader principle.”\n\n“But they gave birth to y–“\n\n“I made myself, Ron,” Harry said firmly. \n\n“Give me your wand, boy,” Voldemort hissed.\n\n“I cannot do that. This wand represents my wealth, which is itself a tangible result of my achievements. Wealth is the product of man’s capacity to think,” Harry said bravely.\n\nVoldemort gasped.\n\n“There is a level of cowardice lower than that of the conformist: the fashionable non-conformist.”\n\nVoldemort began to melt. Harry lit a cigarette, because he was the master of fire.\n\n“The smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of minorities. The minimum wage is a tax on the successful. The market will naturally dictate the minimum wage without the government stepping in to determine arbitrary limits.”\n\nVoldemort howled.\n\n“I’m going to sell copies of my wand at an enormous markup,” Harry said, “and you can buy one like everyone else.”\n\nVoldemort had been defeated.\n\n“He hated us for our freedom,” Ron said.\n\n“No, Ron,” Harry said. “He hated us for our free markets.”\n\nHermione ached with desire for the both of them to master her, but nobody paid her any attention.\n\n\"\"Girls are a waste of time Ron\"\" explained Harry. \"\"Young men spend time chasing them that they could spend on self improvement instead. At least that's what Jordan Peterson says . And Jordan knows everything. By the time I've read a self improvement book and listened to the Joe Rogan podcast, brief manual stimulation to a selection of pornographic videos is the only intimacy I require.\"\"\n\n\"\"But Harry... I'm so lonely.. all of the time.. and I think it's driving me mad..\"\" \n\n\"\"Life is mad Ron. True sanity can only be found in the pursuit of nature. And whilst primitively mankind's biological needs are to reproduce and survive, mankind has evolved. Poverty is our only predator, wealth our one sanctity from the forlorn rags of growing old.\"\"\n\n\"\"I dunno Harry.. I think I'd feel a lot better about life if I was shagging Hermione\"\"\n\n\"\"Trust me, Ron, when your expansive knowledge of financial markets lands you a top internship at Gringotts the girls will be forming a queue. Forget Hermione, forget all of the girls at this school. As apex predators we will be able to mate with partners of our choosing. \"\"\n\nThey stood in silence now on the top of the astronomy tower. A soft breeze rustled the autumn leaves on the ground below and scattered them silently over the Great Lake. The giant squid swam near the shore, intermittently breaking the surface of the water with a strong crash before returning to the depths below. Ron looked out over the long, long skies of Hogwarts and dreamt of love and romance and the soft touch of woman. He had learned that a man can only be an economist for so long before he longs to be a man again and for music and dancing and girls. Harry began to explain how using game theory he had decided that the Patel twins would make the optimal dates to the Yule Ball and Ron sighed silently. But Harry needed him. His parents were both dead and he'd be all on his own otherwise. And so, in the gryffindor boys dormitory, when the sun goes down at Hogwarts and the immense castle becomes black and silent except for a flicker of a candle and a shadow on a wall, Ron Weasley dreams of Hermione Granger.\"\n","date":"Jan 18, 2020, 1:22 PM"},{"content":"15362 - you ever post something on here and afterwards realize that you unwittingly put too many clues for your close friends to figure out that its you and now they’re gonna tag you and you gotta either own up to it or act like the stuff you talk about on a regular basis does not indicate that number ****** is actually you\n","date":"Jan 18, 2020, 1:21 PM"},{"content":"\"15361 - Omnivores: *eat factory-farmed, unsustainable meat from McDonald's and other bullshit sources with no regard for sustainability.*\n\nAlso omnivores: \"\"But what about sustainable practices?

In my view, people have to really try to fit into the label of “vegan” or “vegetarian” and compel themselves to stick to those diets strictly when it might be more sustainable in the long run to try being 80% vegetarian or pescatarian for a while and gradually pushing yourself when you feel as if you can sustain going further. I suggest setting rules when you’d like to improve your habits, such as “I’ll choose vegetarian options when I’m eating at dining halls or making food for myself, but if I’m going out to eat or if someone makes me food I’m allowed to eat some meat”. Inconvenience can be a big hurdle when it comes to limiting your intake of animal products (e.g. your friends bring you to a restaurant where they put meat or butter in everything except the fries), so don’t be discouraged if you choose to eat something you normally wouldn’t allow yourself too. The main thing is making gradual improvements in a way that is easy enough for you to sustain in the future. That means ensuring you keep up the diet in a healthy way by eating the right foods and supplementing what you’re not getting (highly recommend that anyone who’s going vegetarian/vegan use the app Cronometer to plug in their foods for a few days and see what nutrients they might be missing; common deficiencies are B12, iron, omega-3s, folate)\n\nEating less meat (especially beef) is probably the single best way to reduce your environmental impact. Yes, our environmental concerns are mainly because of corporations but I do believe that it is worth it to make the effort. When enough people opt out of or reduce consumption of meat and advocate for plant-based alternatives, then the demand begins to shift more towards those alternatives. That causes restaurants to add vegetarian options, because they know if there’s a vegetarian friend in a group, they could lose multiple customers by not being a viable option for that group. That causes dining halls to provide vegan options (luckily at Brown they provide enough to where you can eat completely vegan at the dining halls for a year and not go insane). Supermarkets begin stocking more options for plant eaters (that’s why there’s so many plant milks and fake meats available now). This, in turn, makes it more accessible for others to choose differently.\n\nI understand that diets that limit consumption of animal products aren’t accessible to everybody. However, I’d like to urge you all to try to make small changes wherever possible and push yourself to eat better. You know that animal agriculture in the US is cruel and highly taxing to the environment, and if you don’t I recommend you educate yourself on the topic (watch Kurt Geszagt’s video on meat or Cowspiracy or one of the many other films/videos). Environmental and political advocacy are the most important things you should be taking up in response to the current climate crisis, but making personal choices that support the mission alongside those efforts are an admirable part of gradually transforming our society into one that’s more sustainable in the future. Plus, most of you who haven’t made an effort would probably see health improvements in switching from what you’re eating now to less red meat and more fish and vegetables. For my fellow athletes, if Clarence Kennedy can clean and jerk over 500 lbs and do all the other crazy shit he does on a plant-based diet, I’m sure you’ll function fine on a few more plants. Make the change (gradually if you’re new), and if you agree with what’s been said here, encourage your meat-eating friends to make the change too. In my opinion, it’s been easy and convenient to be vegetarian here and I’ve made an effort to improve so that in due time I’ll be granted my vegan powers.

Like Waterloo, which Hart represents, South Bend is a once-thriving Midwestern city with a higher-than-average unemployment rate and a history of racial discord.\nThe Buttigieg campaign hopes Hart's endorsement will help not only inoculate the 37-year-old Buttigieg from the stubborn notion that he cannot win black support but also potentially resonate beyond majority-white Iowa, as Buttigieg winds his way through the Democratic primary campaign.\n“He's taken an industrial place like South Bend, Indiana, which is kind of similar to the story of Waterloo, Iowa, where a lot of people had given up on that community, and made great strides to turning it around,” Hart said of Buttigieg.\n\nThe endorsement comes three weeks before Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses. Polls show Buttigieg, who served two terms as mayor from 2012 to early this year, in a tightly grouped pack at the top, along with former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nWaterloo, a city of about 68,000 residents, has a black population of 16%, less than South Bend's roughly 27%.\n“Just like in South Bend and Waterloo, we’re placed in situations where it seems like we’re responsible to fix generations of decline, to fix generational and systemic racism or problems that we’ve had,” said Hart, who is the first black mayor of Waterloo and is in his third term.\nThe campaign hopes that Hart, who has also dealt with racial unrest involving policing in his city, can inspire others to follow him, especially in subsequent nominating contests with greater racial diversity, such as the Feb. 29 South Carolina primary.\n“I think I can play a role moving forward with the campaign,\"\" Hart said. \"\"That's the hope of Mayor Pete as well.”\"\n","date":"Jan 16, 2020, 12:12 PM"},{"content":"15239 - Anybody looking to buy Kaplan MCAT books?

However, from a purely economic standpoint nuclear is vastly inferior to both wind and solar. \n\nSome data on costs: (for reference, LCOE is the levelized cost of energy and denotes the \"\"minimum constant price at which electricity must be sold in order to break even over the lifetime of the project\"\")\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott/2019/10/29/clean-energy-will-continue-to-hit-dirty-power-as-costs-continue-to-fall/#5eab89461981\nLCOE for onshore wind is $0.047 per kWh\nLCOE for offshore wind is $0.078 per kWh, and Denmark and the Netherlands are building wind farms that are expected to achieve prices of $0.053 to $0.064 per kWh\nLCOE for solar PV is $0.051 kWh, and Brazil, India, Mexico and Texas already have solar farms with prices between $0.026 and $0.036 per kWh\n\nhttps://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/economic-aspects/economics-of-nuclear-power.aspx\nLCOE for onshore wind is $0.052 per kWh\nLCOE for solar PV is $0.067 per kWh\nLCOE for nuclear is $0.099 per kWh\n\nhttps://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf\nCost of energy farms/plants entering service in 2023:\nLCOE of onshore wind: average $0.056 per kWh, lowest is 0.039 per kWh\nLCOE of solar PV: on average $0.060 per kWh, lowest is $0.043 per kWh\nLCOE of nuclear: on average $0.078 per kWH, lowest is $0.075 per kWh\n\nhttps://www.lazard.com/perspective/lcoe2019/\nThe cost of onshore wind has fallen about 70% over the last decade\nThe cost of solar PV has fallen about 90% over the last decade\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-nuclearpower/nuclear-energy-too-slow-too-expensive-to-save-climate-report-idUSKBN1W909J\nThe cost of nuclear has increased about 23% over the last decade, the only energy source to have risen in price.\n\nThe data overwhelmingly points to onshore wind and solar being cheaper than nuclear, with or without subsidies, and the discrepancy between the prices will only increase over time as nuclear gets more expensive and wind/solar prices fall. In addition, the primary source of new energy farms/plants are private firms, and given the much longer return-on-capital period for nuclear compared to solar and wind, and coupled with decreasing electricity costs, investors are much more likely to invest in lower-capital, quicker return-on-investment options like wind and solar; indeed, the market data reflects this.\n\nWhat this means is that any plan to fight climate change that is centered around nuclear power is doomed to fail, given increasing costs, lack of private interest, and long implementation periods. I'm not asking for an immediate decommissioning of all existing nuclear power plants, but there is little reason to center climate plans around nuclear or build new plants, especially in countries that already have them.\"\nUpdated Jan 13, 2020, 10:15 PM\n","date":"Jan 13, 2020, 10:15 PM"},{"content":"554* - Which dean is the best to talk to if I totally bombed a final and dropped a letter grade due to an external circumstance?

I do love Brown a lot, but despite being a pretty social/outgoing person I’ve found it difficult to fit in and thrive socially. I have a good number of close and amazing friendships, but I feel I haven’t been able to develop a group. Despite having many good friends, they are all somewhat disjointed and not really part of a unified social circle. Not really being in a group often makes me feel lonely and isolated, even if I know there are good people here who care about me. It’s hard to not feel like I’m the only one who doesn’t have that solid friend group to chill with on a Saturday night, go to spring weekend with, make housing plans with and all the other things you do with your squad. I’ve tried clubs, I’ve made good friends from classes, dorm, etc. but a group has never really fallen into place. When I’ve talked about this to people, many tell me that it’s normal and more people feel this way in college than one might think - please tell me I’m not the only one who feels this way.\n","date":"Jan 13, 2020, 10:11 PM"},{"content":"15198 - What’s the deadline for 257 Thayer && if I’m on full aid, could I manage to afford it?\n","date":"Jan 13, 2020, 10:11 PM"},{"content":"15197 - my friend only seems to contact me when he needs or wants something\n","date":"Jan 13, 2020, 10:11 PM"},{"content":"15196 - How does one learn more about entrepreneurship and business at brown?

As the conversation developed, I could sense he had a really strange attitude. It was a combination of an unearned sense of superiority, unnecessary oppositional behavior, and inexplicable misdirected hostility, all poorly concealed under a thin veil of self-serving liberalism.\n\nMy spidey senses were tingling so I asked, \"\"hey just curious, what was your major in university?\"\" But I already knew the answer.\n\n\"\"Philosophy\"\" he said, proudly.\n\n\"\"Oh, cool...\"\" I said, rolling my eyes, flooded with memories of past Tinder escapades from my late teens and early 20s.\n\nIn my experience, men who study philosophy are just... the worst people. Women who study philosophy are fine, because they just want to read and learn and have cool discussions. Whereas men who have studied philosophy seek to dominate.\n\nThey are so convinced of their own genius that they constantly interrupt or talk over me. They will go on and on mansplaining a basic concept I'm already familiar with. They're boring. They don't actually listen to what I have to say and instead wait for me to stop talking (or they don't bother and just interrupt) so they they can parrot some canned talking point they saw on Reddit.\n\nIf I expess any kind of opinion, they immediately play \"\"devil's advocate\"\" and argue against literally any position I take, not because they actually believe it, but because they just love the sound of their own voice. To them, every conversation has \"\"winners\"\" and \"\"losers\"\", and no matter how objectively, factually, demonstrably wrong they are, they will still argue until they are blue in the face. If they sense they are \"\"losing\"\" a \"\"debate\"\" (aka a normal conversation) they often resort to cheap derailing tactics, logical fallacies, and \"\"whataboutism\"\"\n\nNow, I graduated with honors from a prestigious university. I'm no dummy. I've done my fair share of reading. I can discuss Hegel, Heidegger, and Sartre just as good if not better than most male self-described philosophers.\n\nFrankly, I've never met a male philosophy student who wasn't a contrarian, arrogant, narcissist, and misogynist. (Fun fact: many of the gReAt philosophers thought women were like children at best, and evil and sinister at worst). It's almost like the only reason these dudes studied philosophy was to learn the vocabulary and argumentation needed to justify and reinforce their distorted attitudes about themselves, the world, and women.\n\nUnfortunately, because I chose to study liberal arts, I've been surrounded by such men in school, work, and friend circles. I've even been on dates with some of them. Fortunately, my education has equipped me with the vocabulary, argumentation, critical thinking skills, and mental fortitude needed to defeat and avoid them.\n\nLast night I finished my one drink as quickly as possible and slammed it on the table. Without even waiting for him to finish whatever dull talking point he was trying to make, I stood up abruptly, said \"\"thanks for the drink\"\" and left.\n\nHe texted me later asking what happened. When I didn't reply within minutes, he texted me again insulting me and saying I STOLE from him because I didn't pay for my drink. So, I blocked him.\n\nIn conclusion: never date a guy who studied philosophy. Huge red flag. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.\n\nEdit: I would also like to add libertarians to the \"\"do not date\"\" list. They are basically sociopaths dressing up their distorted morals as a political philosophy.\"\n","date":"Jan 13, 2020, 10:10 PM"},{"content":"15190 - which candidates voted against the war in Iran?\n","date":"Jan 13, 2020, 10:09 PM"},{"content":"15189 - Has anyone ever done swimming lessons at the Nelson?

Yet, during one of his patrols, he overheard hitler say something so detestable, so horrific, that even Heinz shuddered at the thought.

The annoying thing is I've taken classes at another top school, and BROWN CLASSES ARE SO MUCH HARDER. I took enough classes in my concentration from both to compare the two fairly, and the difference is truly astounding.\nThe only reason Brown gets the \"\"easy ivy\"\" rep is because of 1) S/NC and 2) no distribution requirements. But that doesn't make an individual class easier to do well in. It just means you're slightly less frustrated by life because you don't have to take a philosophy class if you don't want to. Also I think because of the lack of distribution requirements, the number of concentration requirements is higher. If you're CS, look at Harvard's CS requirements and weep at how few classes they need for their degree. So if you S/NC two concentration requirements, you're still taking a million others for a grade.\nThe end.

Yet, foreign policy will not change across these platforms. Why? Both political parties have contributed to these regime change wars for decades across the world. Both liberals and conservatives need to stop jumping on the war bandwagons depending on the current president. Yes, you can be liberal and still disagree with Obama’s foreign policy. Yes, you can be conservative and disagree with Trump’s foreign policy. \n\nTo genuinely debate the assassination of Soleimani or any conflict at that matter, READ THE HISTORY. \n\n-First off, understand the Shi’a and Sunni conflict in Islam. This allows you to understand the political divide of most nations in the Middle East. For example, Iran (a Shi’a majority country) is in constant conflict with Saudi Arabia (a Sunni majority country). \n\n-In 1953, The CIA led a coup d’ etat to overthrow the democratically elected Shah Mohammad Mosaddegh to replace him with his son, Shah Reza Pahlavi. The United States set up this puppet regime in order to have control of the country’s oil. The new Shah was forced to westernize Iran at an alarming rate, completely ignoring the Shi’a traditions of the country. In 1979, the Islamic Revolution arose and set up the current government. \n\n-In 1980, the USA supported Saddam Hussein’s troops (yes, the USA supported Saddam Hussein, but media tries to erase that part of history) against Iran. This adds to Iran’s hate of American policy.\n\n-Fast forward fo September 11th, 2001. Extremists flew into the World Trade Center. Not a single one of those extremists were from Iran. On the contrary, 15 of the 19 were from SAUDI ARABIA (OUR ALLY) which promotes Wahhabism, the extremist ideology of ISIS and Al Qaeda.\n\n-Fast forward a couple of years, The USA goes to war with Saddam Hussein with fear of “weapons of mass destruction!” These were never found and led to the death of 1 million Iraqis and thousands of American soldiers. USA now had access to the country’s riches and natural resources. Yet, this led to the growth of Iran’s influence in Iraq. \n\n-The USA has set up an almost complete economic embargo on Iran and crippled the country. \n\n-In 2011, the USA aids in the war against Syrian President Bashar Al Assad, Iran’s strongest ally in the region, increasing tensions with the country. The USA aids and trains rebel groups that eventually form into ISIS and other terrorist groups that sweep the regions of Iraq and Syria. Iran’s Soleimani steps into to prevent the fall of the Syrian government and aids in the defeat of many of these rebel groups. \n\n——\nTrump’s claim that Soleimani was “planning an imminent attack on Americans” comes from the same American “intelligence” community that stated Saddam Hussein had “weapons of mass destruction.” The claim that Soleimani killed American lives is also a little grey. He is by no means innocent and was in charge of the IRGC that aided in the Iraqi resistance against America back in 2003 that led to the deaths of Americans. Yet, go back into history and ask the question “WHY WERE WE ILLEGALLY IN IRAQ!? WHICH KILLED 1 MILLION IRAQIS” Once again, this shows the American Foreign policy double standard. \n\nWe need to grasp the concept that America, and any country in the world at that matter, is not looking to promote “freedom,” “democracy,” and destroy “oppressors.” It is all a power grab and that is politics. America will attack a certain country to increase their influence in the region and control its natural resources under the mask of “FREEDOM!” And we unfortunately believe it. \n\nThe USA stands in strong support of Saudi Arabia, a country which has strong and clear links to Al Qaeda and is the birthplace of ISIS ideology. Saudi Arabia is responsible for the death of thousands of Americans, and we ignore these facts because they buy billions of dollars worth of weaponry. Saudi Arabia till this day has been known to perform public beheadings and hangings. America supports Israel that has established a 70+ year apartheid on Palestinian people. Several countries in Africa are run by dictators that no one cares about because these countries don’t offer natural resources or a geopolitical location in the world. \n\nDon’t be afraid to question why governments do what they do. You are not a conspirator or an anarchist. You are an American citizen that is concerned for the lives of Marines that should not be fighting a pointless war. You are also a human and should understand these wars result in the death of millions of civilians in the Middle East that media will call “collateral damage.”\"\n","date":"Jan 8, 2020, 1:36 PM"},{"content":"15029 - Dear Blueno can be a place full of toxicity, unnecessary arguments, and the remnants of an unproductive call-out culture.

To explicitly state for the world to see how many students specifically did not either receive a C or NC in your course was rude, inconsiderate, and frankly elitist. You are essentially shaming anyone who didn’t do “as well” as 98% of the students, while failing to consider any personal issues, student drops, and other academic reasons that may have caused such a grade. I did not take your course this semester (not for I plan to), but I am personally always happy in a sense to receive a C. This is because even though I’d like to do better it reminds me that I can still succeed at an ivy league institution, and consider any C to be better than an NC.

I gave a bit of endearment by skimming some sections.. However if we use subjective lens we can see that peer relations have a connection based on commonality whether the shared interests are of materials or of ideals towards life such as art, media etc. If we pan the objective side, as reality is both subjective and objective though operates mostly within frames of objectivity, then we conclude that the obvious necessity of one’s counselor to reflect their race is highly crucial to therapy sessions.. Though the race of the therapist may be less a variable impedance to caucasians, there persists a need for a psychologists to ethnically reflect the individual patients as there may be intersectional familiarity of experiences, as we live in a racialize society*. A psychiatrist is trained knowing how a behavior causes another behavior, not clarity of the brain’s functions. Schoolchildren look up to their teachers, they are mentors and on the spot therapists,, then yes responses and connections and improvements to character may be more readily assessable if the teacher ethnically reflects the students. The article take good induction of ethnographic research, though Ms. Lee doesn’t correlate the research to a precise conclusion. I wonder how long the contemplation was before giving a shot at the article.. To conclude I like to put simply, OF COURSE it matters.\n","date":"Jan 8, 2020, 1:35 PM"},{"content":"\"15016 - topics: sexual assault, dissociation\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.In response to the recent discussion about experiences of sexual assault, here is a short excerpt from something I wrote when attempting to comprehend being assaulted myself. Note this may be trigger if you've had similar experiences:\n\nPareidolia. The jellyfish on the wall reminds you of the figures you spotted in clouds years ago. Like every other curious child, you’d lie on the grass pointing at passing shapes. There were no big words, deep thoughts, or tricky meanings. It was just you and your unicorn friends in the sky. Yesterday your mind may have allowed chasing fascinations, but today your mind had no room for anything but reality. The jellyfish escape only districted you from one slow movement. \n\nYou shutter and your eyes clench shut. The jellyfish is gone but at least the darkness behind your frail eyelids disconnects one of your senses from reality. As you embrace this darkness, a hand touches your empty stomach. Cold fingertips push deeper into your skin. As you lose the ability to breathe, the pressure increases. \n\nAlarms, sirens, and screams echo through your mind. And every fiber of your body needs to make it stop. Yet you lie motionless. Mental dissociation seems the most promising escape. A body is just flesh and you can pretend it is not yours.

I had a friend who treated me and many of their other close friends badly due to their own personal issues and lack of experience with relationships, and to cut a long story short, we aren’t on speaking terms anymore even though we were inseparable for years. It sucks to lose someone like that, no matter whose fault it is.\n\nI don’t know if this advice applies to your situation, but if you really want to fix things the first step is usually to take a long hard look in the mirror. You may feel like you’re causing other people pain due to a lack in social intelligence, but more often than not it’s a lack of self-awareness that causes people to inappropriately handle difficult social situations. If you’re not aware of your own tendencies, it’s really hard to empathise with others in a meaningful way and it’s really easy to get caught up in your own confusion and forget that everyone else has feelings too. Regardless, trying to force yourself to forget something causing you constant pain isn’t healthy—as much as it sucks, sometimes the only sustainable solution is to face your problems directly. It seems like you’re already starting to do that, which is a great first step.\n\nAs far as this person is concerned, if they have told you they don’t want you to contact them you absolutely need to respect that. If that isn’t the case and you feel that you still owe them an apology, make it an honest one. Don’t make excuses—just explain specifically what you did wrong and how it was hurtful, that you regret your actions and the pain you caused, and that you’re taking specific concrete steps to do better. Remember that this person is never under any obligation to forgive you or take you back into their life, even if you do everything right from now on. That being said, a heartfelt apology could help you both start a new chapter, or at least find closure. \n\nGiven that I don’t know your situation, please take all this with a grain of salt and disregard it entirely if it doesn’t apply to you. I just wanted to let you know that you’re not alone and you will get past this, one way or another.

However, if you are pretty close and there is something already budding there, you do not have to wait six months until fall semester to date the person lmfao, wtf? Just maybe ask them out before classes start or whatever. Or keep it on the down-low — if someone reports you for dating your student, how would the school know that you weren’t just “dating beforehand,” which the commenters seem to think is fine? LOLOL...\n\nTo the frequent commenters really being so black and white about “dating a TA”:\n1. There is no reason why dating a TA versus being a close friend would jeopardize the ability to be a TA. AKA friends will pressure you just as much as an SO for grades and unfair advantages. It’s up to the TA to have good morals and be fair, and let the proper people know about ANY relationship, romantic or otherwise, prior to the semester so as to mitigate bias.\n2. If you actually know someone well beforehand, even if you’re not yet dating, the “power dynamics” of being someone else’s TA won’t pressure the student into accepting the relationship or whatever. If you are pursuing a student you just met or are just getting close to during this semester though, then hold off.\n3. If you want to cry about school rules, stop being hypocritical and be upset that people dating their SOs before the semester can also enter into a TA-student relationship. After all, the rules say that NO TA CAN DATE A STUDENT IN THE CLASS. You don’t have to follow every rule exactly as written and there’s a lot more gray area than you’re making it seem. Both me and my SO have been each other’s TAs before even though we started dating before that and most of the time, we didn’t even remember that this was the case. If two people are on the verge of dating, it doesn’t fucking matter if one of them is a TA and the other is a student. Life is too short to be dictated by fake ass rules some administrators wrote up.\n\nTo all the people who are on the verge of dating, but one is about to be a TA, just fucking DO IT and stop posting bait just to get the same couple of people saying the same thing. I feel like it’s bait at this point, just like the posts about squirting. You do not need someone else’s permission to ask someone out; if a person tells on you for this, they are either too nosy for their own good or they have too much free time. Either way, it’s fucking sad. \n\"\n","date":"Jan 3, 2020, 12:02 PM"},{"content":"\"488* - topics: greek life drama, sexual assault\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n1.

If it offends you, I'm not sorry, you need to just grow a damn spine.\n\nYesterday I walked into Starbucks (by accident, I was all out of my usual Death Wish). I waited in line and was immediately noticed by all the beta nu-males because of the \"\"I Love Guns and Killing\"\" Grunt Style t-shirt I wear everywhere because I like making people uncomfortable and reminding them that I'm a veteran. The hot barista (who wore too much make up and was probably an e-thot) also noticed me and was probably impressed when I ordered a black coffee with a shot of espresso, none of that gay foo-foo shit that hipsters with scarves like to drink.\n\nI was waiting for my masculine coffee when I noticed the TV above the lounge area playing a commercial for \"\"Cats\"\" on the CNN channel. I immediately demanded that they change the channel to either ESPN or Fox News. There’s no reason for anyone to watch the Commie News Network. Nobody really listened to me; I tried making eye contact with the hot barista but she was just studiously avoiding looking at me. I figured that maybe my \"\"Murder Time is Fun Time, I Have Killed People Please Notice Me\"\" shirt wasn't working so I took out my dog tags and let them angrily clink together as I started shouting, \"\"Turn off this goddamn liberal propaganda and turn on some fucking Duck Dynasty!\"\"\n\nThat was when I heard a voice from behind me say \"\"hey, friend, why so angry during the holidays?\"\" I turned around to see Mister Mistoffelees the magic cat staring at me from the TV screen. I could see his weird looking, too-human lips and his whiskers smushing a little against the glass.\n\n\"\"Surely you've got some festive spirit in you,\"\" the cat abomination continued.\n\n\"\"It's Christmas,\"\" I said, immediately drawing my 1911 .45 ACP, which I open carry to trigger liberals. \"\"Not \"\"the holidays.\"\" Ever notice how it's ok to say \"\"Happy Hannukah\"\" and \"\"happy Radaman\"\" but not \"\"Merry Christmas?\"\"\"\"\n\nMistoffelees giggled, and the CGI meant to make his nose look more like a cat’s went fucking crazy. “Nothing wrong with a little tolerance.”\n\n“Tolerance is how we got 9/11,” I replied, raising my gun.\n\nMistoffelees giggled again, then screamed, “Ia! Ia! Nariboath ruk ‘shuul!” and pressed his face harder against the glass. Suddenly his whiskers and his entire head were out of the television, and then his shoulders. I squeezed the trigger, putting a round through the television, but it was too late, he hit the ground with a wet smack, and I realized that it wasn’t a cat, or a man, or anything at all, just a formless no-thing in the guise of a furry, a hideous servitor of dread Nariboath, the devourer of Neo-Babylon and Grand Consumer of the Etruton Host.\n\nI fired again, but there were already more no-things squeezing through the glass, flopping onto the ground, shivering and laughing and screaming. I jumped back up onto the counter, sending some beta cuck’s soy mocha frappe cappuccino with extra cum froth flying to the ground. The hot barista who had noticed me open carrying and been turned on by my display of masculinity screamed in a way specifically designed to excite my male urge to protect in order to procreate, but by remembering the lessons of the philosophers Stefan Molyneux and Jordan Petersen, I prevented myself from being ensnared by her siren call. “Men go their own way,” I said masculinly, before backflipping behind the counter for cover as a howling abomination wearing the face of Rum Tum Tugger came shrieking across the café toward me.\n\nI had clearly triggered the extradimensional horrors with my flagrant disregard for liberal cultural norms in favor of Western chauvinism and Christian supremacy. They attempted to virtue signal at me by absorbing the hot barista (who honestly wasn’t that hot, she was wearing makeup designed to elicit a sexual response, not unlike a lobster) and the other patrons into a seething mass of flesh that writhed with arcane energies, melting together and then pulling apart like wet clay, the sound of peeling flesh drowned only by the screams of those damned who yet did not die. “You’re just virtue signaling,” I screamed as I emptied the magazine to no avail. “It’s ok to be a white male! Duck Dynasty, motherfuckers!” I reloaded and shot myself in the dick to prove how masculine and powerful and not gay I am.\n\nThis was, without a doubt, the worst experience I’ve ever had. Starbucks may have gotten some of my money this time, but it’ll never happen again. The fact that they think its acceptable to discriminate against combat veterans, like myself, simply because we’re god-fearing, law-abiding conservatives who support Trump is beyond me. I hope you’ll all join me in #BoycottingStarbucks, and demanding to know if allowing extra-dimensional cat demons to harass their patrons is standard practice or just something the owner of the local franchise is responsible for.\"\n","date":"Dec 27, 2019, 9:41 PM"},{"content":"14789 - anyone interested in a quick winter job and want to build a website for a new company?\n","date":"Dec 27, 2019, 9:41 PM"},{"content":"14788 - i lost my key early in the year and haven’t replaced it bc my roommates are usually home/ the front door to our suite is often open. i really need a new key but i’ve heard that if you lose your key to a suite all the locks have to be changed (on top of the huge fee) and i rlly don’t want to pay/go through this!! is there any way around it!\n","date":"Dec 27, 2019, 9:41 PM"},{"content":"14787 - Why can't we use meal plan at local restaurants?

Of course everyone is responsible for their own work, but when a vast majority of a class is frustrated and angry about the Prof and their teaching, it's not the students being entitled to a certain grade. If I wanted to \"read a textbook\" I wouldn't f---ing take Orgo 2 at Brown I would read the textbook and learn it myself (which is basically what had to be done anyway). What's the point of saying learn how to read a textbook? That argument is idiotic; students take classes to learn the material not to be told to read the textbook and learn it themselves. People have legitimate criticism of the class and while the Piazza post came off as somewhat rude I'm sure it came from a place of frustration. The Prof asked TopHat questions on Yom Kippur and the day before Thanksgiving, was unresponsive via email and on piazza, and misrepresented the material that was going to be tested, to only name a few things that I found a little ridiculous. It's frustrating to deal with this a whole semester in addition to teaching yourself all or most of the material in a class that is already hard enough on its own. Congratulations if you're such a genius that you can succeed in these conditions but most people can't, and to make these rude generalizations and comments, especially saying that they won't succeed in med school, is counterproductive and ignorant.\n","date":"Dec 25, 2019, 3:14 PM"},{"content":"448* - does Brown have any pottery classes?\n","date":"Dec 25, 2019, 3:14 PM"},{"content":"447* - i’m a lesbian, and i want to be friends w more lesbians\n","date":"Dec 25, 2019, 3:14 PM"},{"content":"\"446* - Here's my sure-fire cinnamon roll recipe.

Yes, these large lecture introductory classes are difficult and inconvenient, but imagine trying to make a class that will make everyone in the class happy. I've been through all the large introductory classes and I'm not saying that just because I did it, why can't others bc I totally understand people are coming into these classes with different backgrounds of knowledge and privilege. But, what I have seen are many professors trying SO hard to make the class accessible, engaging, and interesting to the students and being met with vitriol and hate. The complaints I understand are coming from a place of frustration, but refusing to filter that and look at the professor's side and believing you are entitled to a class that is catering to your every need is insane. Bassu's assignment was an extra credit assignment that was not required. It's crazy people were so mad at him for releasing an optional assignment that could only help their grade. Even annual complaints about Phys 0030 and Chem 0330 and orgo especially on piazza is insane. You do realize these professors are trying to teach mostly students who won't major in that department and are only taking that class as a requirement? So they're putting in effort to teach these large classes of students who only take it for a grade and have no interest in the material. The professors genuinely wish the students were focused on the material more, instead of the grade, which most premed students due. During this holiday, let's just have a little sympathy to these professors and filter our hate and frustration at them because they have lives and also are deeply affected by our negative comments, or at least not spew hatred from every Dear Blueno Post lol.\n","date":"Dec 20, 2019, 12:39 PM"},{"content":"\"422* - Finals are hard, but breaking my pex is harder\n\nhttps://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/gen8ou-1032368368\n\nSide note: Toxapex is dumb and I love it\n\"\n","date":"Dec 20, 2019, 12:39 PM"},{"content":"14652 - did anyone else get fucked by the ECON 1620 exam this morning?? i need someone to make me feel better so lets chat in the comments below about how hard it was is it curved? geez i hope so\n","date":"Dec 20, 2019, 12:39 PM"},{"content":"14651 - I already miss my friends :(\n","date":"Dec 20, 2019, 12:39 PM"},{"content":"14650 - Does anybody know what the cutoffs for math 0090 will be?\n","date":"Dec 20, 2019, 12:39 PM"},{"content":"\"14649 - no:\nliterally no one:\nChem 0330: FUCK YOU\"\n","date":"Dec 20, 2019, 12:39 PM"},{"content":"14648 - is it just me or was immunology structured poorly this semester?

I’m circumcised but wish I never had been. It’s a nonconsensual form of genital mutilation that causes very young children unnecessary pain. It leads (again, needlessly) to the possibility of infection, hemorrhage, and other potential medical complications. It has negatively affected my ability to derive pleasure from the revolutionary act of queer lovemaking. I understand that circumcised penises stand less chance of becoming infected and that the anatomy of the foreskin can trap other fluids and assist the spread of HIV, but with proper hygiene education these issues are preventable and still are not self-contained justifications for circumcision. Foremost for me, though, is the issue of bodily autonomy. I had no choice in this process and would never have chosen it for myself. (Methods for foreskin restoration do exist, but they take years and are a large inconvenience to the person undergoing them. No one should feel forced to undergo this process, and it is a process exclusionary to people without the financial means to purchase the equipment and/or seek medical advice, and is exclusionary to working people who don’t have the time to sit through hours of treatment.) (I also recognize that circumcision is for some people a religious requirement, but in mine and many other people’s cases, it was not—it is simply a societal norm that is pushed onto young children by parents who have not considered the ramifications of the operation and their place of privilege in deciding it be done for their child. I do want to push the envelope here and ask to what extent we will not speak out against socially enforced practices—which includes religious practices—which are damaging to a human body. Do a parents’ devoutly held religious beliefs trump the autonomy of their child, whose own religious beliefs they can influence but never ultimately decide?) I’m hoping to start a civil dialogue about this topic, because it’s one I never hear intelligently discussed even though I think it is an alienating and damaging practice which we should be much more critical of.\n","date":"Dec 18, 2019, 12:38 PM"},{"content":"401* - I would like to say, as a very devout catholic, the Christmas crane meme on BDSM is absolutely HILARIOUS!!!!

And kudos to them for the many reasonable arguments they put out that kept me on the fence about my stance because the really insensitive comments I’m seeing from a lot of pro choicers on dear blueno implying the general worthlessness of babies are honestly scaring me and definitely not persuading me of this viewpoint. Aborting a person minutes before they would have naturally left the womb and saying that because they haven’t left the womb yet, they’re not a real person with rights? Calling babies parasites and lumps of meat? I was under the assumption it wasn’t really up for debate that at some point a fetus becomes developed enough that it is definitely a person and sentient being with rights and thoughts and feelings and ability to feel sensations such as pain (which it most definitely feels when it is aborted and dies after it has reached this development stage) and most of the abortion debate was about things like quality of life. A good portion of the arguments and logic I see here being applied to fetuses could very well be applied to young children as well and that’s scary. \n\nAlso I see the “mother’s life is in danger” argument/scenario a lot on dear blueno.

I don’t know what’s happened to me. \n\nI kicked ass in high school. I was perennially at the top of the class. Save a few blips, I was generally cheerful and optimistic. It took nothing to rise to the occasion of studying for things and acing them. \n\nHere, I’m a mess. College was supposed to be an extremely fun, life-changing experience, but I’m probably depressed and hopeless 20-30% of the days here. Increasingly, I’m just finding myself wanting to lie in bed and stay there forever. I slept for 10 hours last night. There have even been some scary moments where I’ve contemplated killing myself. \n\nI can’t talk about it with my parents. My mom would freak out if she hears that her perfect son, her golden boy, is woefully depressed. Whenever I tell people—even just a little bit—about my situation, their response is always, “I’m here if you need to talk.” \n\nI’m not sure if talking is what I need. I feel like I need some sort of antidepressant to be honest. And that scares me. I’ve prided myself on not needing antidepressants to be happy. \n\nHere’s a case in point: I was at a friend’s house after thanksgiving, and a wishbone was lying on his counter. We decided to break it together. Of course, I don’t believe in any of that—but I still made a wish. In the past, my wish would’ve been something material—perhaps getting into Brown or getting a prized internship. \n\nI wished that I could just not be sad anymore. That I could find genuine happiness. \n\nI’m going home for winter break soon, and I know that’ll probably ameliorate my situation. But it concerns me quite a bit that school makes me this way now. \"\n","date":"Dec 16, 2019, 12:56 PM"},{"content":"14444 - where are good places to study on north campus\n","date":"Dec 16, 2019, 12:56 PM"},{"content":"14443 - Race at the crane tmw, you’re all invited\n","date":"Dec 16, 2019, 12:55 PM"},{"content":"14442 - IANN DIOR FOR SPRING WEEKEND!!!\n","date":"Dec 16, 2019, 12:55 PM"},{"content":"14441 - Does the U-FLi Center accept textbooks or are there groups on campus that do?\n","date":"Dec 16, 2019, 12:55 PM"},{"content":"14440 - Can anyone, including the administrators, see who posts what on here?\n","date":"Dec 16, 2019, 12:51 PM"},{"content":"14439 - If anyone found & swiped a black North Face jacket, I would appreciate it if I could get that returned\n","date":"Dec 16, 2019, 12:51 PM"},{"content":"14438 - Why is there an old Boomer guy who didn't go to Brown or RISD commenting here on the British election?\n","date":"Dec 16, 2019, 12:51 PM"},{"content":"14437 - CS100 is the biggest shit show of all time\n","date":"Dec 16, 2019, 12:51 PM"},{"content":"14436 - At this point, I feel like my only option is to accept defeat.

(no, because preemies, right?) is it whenever the fetus is removed from the womb? (no, because then the fetus is considered living or non-living based solely on the timing of an action of a third-party, which can happen at an arbitrary time during gestation, rather than life being an inherent characteristic). is it some sort of schroedingers fetus situation then? i am so genuinely curious about this! this is a point that i think is worth active discussion on the abortion position from many different viewpoints, instead of predetermining “which side hates women and which side is the moral Elite tm”\"\n","date":"Dec 13, 2019, 7:26 PM"},{"content":"\"349* - \n/ イ (((ヽ\n( ノ ￣Y \\\n| ( \\ (. /) | )\nヽ ヽ ` ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) _ノ /\n＼ | ⌒Ｙ⌒ / /\n| ヽ | ﾉ ／\n＼トー仝ーイ\n| ミ土彡/\n) \\ ° / \n( \\ / )\n/ / \nѼΞΞΞΞΞΞΞD \n/ / / \\ \\ \\ \n( ( ). ) ). )\n( ).

For one thing, this discourse is ongoing BECAUSE cis people are doing just that, and honestly I’m glad they exist but there are just too many.

After reviewing all the available information, the officers worked with Tech House’s general membership to take the following concrete steps:\n\n- Amended the Tech House constitution to include a section handling complaints concerning members, guests, and alumni. We paid special attention to striking a balance between anonymity and actionability. This clarified the resources Tech House members have to make complaints and what standard procedure is in handling them. The full amendment can be read here (brown email required to view): https://docs.google.com/document/d/17eACyTV-tRkQpb7Mw4LLW5Zyj4waLdskA2ZNI2T-zCs/edit\n- Created two complaints forms, one of which is anonymous, to ensure that complaints can be made easily. We created the anonymous form to ensure that all are empowered to submit grievances in a way with which they are comfortable. The non-anonymous form is available here: https://forms.gle/PYMeM1fx3rxvrkyPA The anonymous form is available here: https://forms.gle/hVhqiu4p7E1KeEjQ7\n- Decided that, starting next semester, two in-house restorative justice circles will be run by our SAPE liaisons.\n- Created a list of Tech House guidelines and community values to clarify expected behavior by members, guests, and alumni.\n\nWhile we are confident in these steps that we’ve already taken, our efforts don’t stop now. Moving forward, we intend to continue discussions about how to make our community the best it can be, review our community guidelines every year to evolve and affirm them, and hold in-house ombudsperson and SAPE liaison “office hours” to ensure their visibility and availability.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to message us on Facebook or email officers@techhouse.org. \"\nUpdated Dec 7, 2019, 1:03 PM\n","date":"Dec 7, 2019, 1:03 PM"},{"content":"300* - I just noticed that one of my classes is marked as S/NC in banner even though I never changed my grade option to that.

I do not believe that helping people with their rent is wrong, or that clubs should not do this- but it should not be done with money that's charged for another purpose. Let's be clear- this is charity. If clubs want to do that, they should raise money, specifically for charity. Yes, that is difficult. Yes, Brown administration doesn't give a shit about this. But that is not justification for using money that was taken for another purpose. A lot of parents and students struggle to pay the Brown tuition, a lot of others do not struggle that much, but it is still a huge expense for them. Financial aid fucks over the middle class and international students. \nOnce again, I am not against this charity but it should be done through proper means.

Are steroids required for this\n","date":"Dec 1, 2019, 10:20 AM"},{"content":"13898 - Hey everyone, I'm a senior here, studying abroad right now, but coming back next semester, and presently reflecting on my time at Brown - in particular, about how much I feel like I've failed and missed out on things, especially having anything resembling a fulfilling social life and sense of belonging and acceptance. So, we've heard people say how Brown is such a wonderful and accepting place that they feel so attached to, and how they've made so many friends. And for those who didn't at first, we've heard about how it all gets better in the end and they're able to come out of their shell and figure things out. Now, I've been working a lot lately on getting my life into shape, and I've tried throughout my years here to succeed socially and feel happy and secure in general, but looking at it now, I realize I've failed, and it's too late to fix that. I was hoping that when I finally escaped my tiny K-12 school and got to college, I would be able to finally come out of my shell. I would finally make a ton of friends, feel like I was part of a strong community, get invited to a ton of fun parties and events, maybe even find a relationship, and in general, feel validated. In contrast, my mental health and self-esteem continually deteriorated throughout my time here, and while I definitely think that I've grown and made friends, I never got anywhere near what I was hoping for. Especially holding in mind these expectations and the idea that \"I'd find my place\" and \"everything would get better,\" my experience at Brown has been continuously full of disappointments, despite the fact that I've been constantly trying to make things better. I constantly felt the clock ticking away as I, having no idea what I was supposed to do, kept running out of chances to have a fulfilling social life and escape the fear of being forever alone. And now, I realize that time is already just about up. So, if I may ask something from other Brown students and alumni, can we acknowledge that it doesn't always get better in the way we hope? Can we have some sympathy for the social outcasts - the people around us who suffer in silence, for years, even? Thank you.\n","date":"Dec 1, 2019, 10:19 AM"},{"content":"13897 - How hard is it to go straight to the buy side in finance/have any seniors done it this year?\n","date":"Dec 1, 2019, 10:19 AM"},{"content":"13896 - So tired of having friends I can’t lean on for support.

The dynamics of antisemitism in Europe don't really work here because America is organized more around race. And when a white Jew argues against a (more likely to be) POC Muslim in a public forum on something like Palestine, the Jewish person is likely to hold a lot of advantages. Muslims often might have to start by proving that they're not \"\"radical\"\" or anti-Semitic (which is applied against Muslims en masse by racists), and they're often arguing to a white audience that already questions their humanity. For example, it's normal for politicians in the US to be openly Islamaphobic and the current president has even tried to ban Muslims from entering. Like, last night Bernie's statement that Palestinians deserve to be treated with \"\"dignity and respect\"\" was somehow treated as super radical.\n\nSo you have to consider that it's not quite an even playing field (not to mention blacklists like Canary Mission which try to intimidate people from speaking out). Being white and Jewish can give someone an advantage in this debate, and it's fair to people to call that out.\"\n","date":"Nov 22, 2019, 1:01 PM"},{"content":"13648 - Anyone at Brown interested in barbershop music?

I hate to be ~that guy~ but I honestly don’t believe that, at Brown, this would (or should) fly with other -isms. However, a previous Dear Blueno post seemed to insinuate that, because Jewish students at Brown “come from wealth and power” (which... yikes) their claims of antisemitism can reasonably be challenged. \n\nWhile Jews belong to many different races worldwide, it’s true that most Jews in the US come from European roots, making it easier for American Jews to “blend in” with the white majority—however, please remember that this is really only possible due to decades of assimilation often at the expense of language, tradition, and culture. While many white Jews have been able to escape hate and discrimination due to this ability to “blend in,” many have not, as the majority of religious hate crimes are targeted at Jews, who make up ~2% of the US population. While many might think that antisemitism is something of the past, or just not really a thing in America (opinion polls demonstrate that this is a relatively common belief among non-Jews), antisemitism is a serious problem in the US. However it’s often only brought into the mainstream consciousness after the next guy shoots up, bombs, or vandalizes a synagogue. \n\nMany Jewish students at Brown are the grandchildren of Holocaust survivors, and the children of those raised by Holocaust survivors. If they’re anything like me, they’ve been raised to be constantly looking over their shoulders—taught that they’re never really completely safe. That regardless of any privilege they have, they should never become complacent because, historically, economic and racial privilege have never protected Jews from genocide, expulsion, or disenfranchisement. This is likely why many Jewish students are so vigilant when the Israel/ Palestine debate comes up, since some (not all!) anti-Israel movements do have a history of virulent antisemitism. \n\nI bring all this up to put into context the discourse about who can determine what is and isn’t antisemitism. While I’m sure it can be frustrating to feel like people are trying to invalidate your arguments with charges of antisemitism, I ask you to please not let these feelings of frustration turn into attempts to in turn invalidate claims of antisemitism coming from Jews themselves—many of whom have been raised to be hyper aware of their surroundings by those affected by the Holocaust.\"\n","date":"Nov 21, 2019, 4:34 PM"},{"content":"13599 - Help me settle a debate: sour cream & onion, or salt & vinegar?\n","date":"Nov 21, 2019, 4:34 PM"},{"content":"13598 - Hi- I've lost my room key that was also attached to a pair of airpods in a blue case- if anyone has found them please please please let me know!!

It’s not okay to tell women what to do with their bodies. I can’t and shouldn’t tell anyone to shave their armpits. But what I can do is inform them about the common perception of women’s body hair, so that if you’re a woman who does care what men/women think (you don’t have to care, but maybe you do), you are now more able to make an informed decision. The fact is that most men aren’t fans of women having body hair, and many are kinda grossed out by it. This has been verified by surveys and studies if you’d like to Google them. Please don’t say that this is problematic for me to say because it is literally a verifiable fact, and is not meant to be offensive to those who choose to not shave. To me personally, it’s a major turn off. I associate body hair with masculinity, so as someone who isn’t attracted to masculine traits, you can see why I’d be turned off. It’s also just kinda gross to me, like even as a dude I don’t like my own body hair. And in addition to all that I’m sure there’s some societal/cultural stuff going on that (for better or worse) has conditioned me to not like it. Again, I’m opening up about my own individual feelings, so take that for what it’s worth and nothing more. Think of it as analogous to having snot hanging out of your nose. I literally have no right to tell you to get rid of it, but I will be grossed out and will probably look away. So yeah, that was my hot take. If you disagree, please don’t call me a misogynist. If I were doing something that was a turn-off to women, I’d kinda want to know so I could make an informed decision of whether my personal preference is more or less important than what will be appealing to the people that I’d like to be attracted to me. My only goal is for people to be more informed so they understand that their choice may affect their attractiveness in the eyes of the preferred gender.

Linda Sarsour is anti-Semitic. You cannot tell me that I’m “taking her statements out of context” or “that’s not what she really meant” — what Sarsour said has hurt me.\"\"\n\nThere are some good points in this article about Sarsour's past statements, but I think this is a problematic definition of antisemitism that deserves to be pushed back on, as I've seen it echoed a lot (13325, 13189) even in reference to Palestine.\n\nMany Jews in campus may not have encountered Palestinian perspectives before coming to Brown, and encountering them for the first time can make many uncomfortable, especially if their families or communities back home are more staunchly Zionist. There were a lot of complaints on this page, for example, that the \"\"Apartheid Wall\"\" display was anti-Semitic, because it made some viewers feel uncomfortable as Jews - rather than any specific parts of the display being problematic. There was a BDH oped at the time (which I didn't write) about someone who initially experienced something that seems similar, and while I don't want to speak for them, I think it's worth linking.\n\nhttp://www.browndailyherald.com/2019/02/27/aman-20-creating-productive-dialogue-israel-palestine/\n\nIf someone feels like Israel is a big part of their Jewish identity, and they dismiss Palestinian activism as anti-Semitic because it makes them feel uncomfortable in a way related to their Jewish identity, then we have to use a definition of antisemitism that goes beyond what makes some people uncomfortable. This issue also affects Palestinians (definitely moreso than American Jews), and their voices deserve to be heard. The debate around israel intersects with a lot of issues (racism, colonialism, etc.) that white Jews especially may not be as prepared to immediately weigh in as they are with other forms of antisemitism. \n\nIt's especially problematic when Jewish allies of Palestinians (like JVP) are dismissed on this page when attempting to defend against claims of antisemitism, as though the original posters feelings of discomfort are final. If you feel that JVP's presence doesn't at least complicate accusations of antisemitism - or warrant further thought - then you're probably valuing some Jewish voices more than others. A lot of people here seem to think that being pro Palestinian somehow makes you less Jewish.\"\n","date":"Nov 20, 2019, 6:07 PM"},{"content":"13499 - Person in Grad Center D (probably 4th floor?) who's always playing music way too loud, you do know headphones exist?

First, wear layers and clothing over all of your body. If you have a couple sweaters and a light rain jacket that will generally do very nicely in all but the worst weather.

Good waterproof hiking boots are a nice to have for snow and slush as well and have a good grip on any ice. You might want to pack an extra pair of shoes and socks though since they can be very warm when you are inside. I know weather clothing isn't exactly cheap but you can very cozy for a budget if you use what you already have and shop carefully.\n\nFinally, for the love of all that is sacred walk single file on the sidewalk so people can get past you especially when much of the sidewalk is covered by snow or ice. \n\nStay warm out there.\"\n","date":"Nov 19, 2019, 4:18 PM"},{"content":"13452 - We need to, as a school, set an example and begin using \"issuematic\" instead of \"problematic\" in conversation.

Similarly, I see anti-Israel people who totally do not care that Israelis face terrorist attacks on a regular basis.

Throughout the semester I have learned that no one will really help you in that class. Some of the TAs are obnoxious or don’t even want to be there. Like why become a TA if your not actually doing it to help people. You should’ve gotten a job at a library or anywhere else. I remember I waited two hours to see a TA, when I got called in, she was hungover, annoyed at everything, and looked at me like if I was an idiot for not fully understanding what WE had just leaned THAT week. After several interactions in which I felt like I could not get the proper help I needed I dropped the class, which hurt me so much since I enjoyed it, and dedicated most of my week for that class, putting other class aside. TA hours are incredibly idiotic too! A person can’t move on with their assignment because there’s a bug in the code, which they can’t identify, and they need to wait about 1 hour and 35 minutes,on average, to be seated with a good or terrible TA, game of chance and no in between, for 10 min or 1 question. Like that does not make sense at all. Other CS classes have their TA OH IN THE COMPUTER ROOM, Cs 33 I believe, a person just raises their hand, gets immediate help, and boom they move on. There’s no need to lock your computer, go upstairs, wait x amount of time, log back in, wait for eclipse to load, THATS A WASTE OF TIME! Even if your the first one to sign up 10 min before the start of OH there is no guarantee that you will be seen first since they randomize the list. Instead of doing skits, and figuring out how you will get Andy their drink every class, actually try to perfect the job you are paid to do before you can start doing skits or whatever. It is really sickening and sad how the TA system works in this class. There is only a handful of TAs that are actually good at their jobs and take the time explain the content, work through problems or whatever. I don’t want to violate the policy to call out people, but if you actually are one of those TAs thank you. You understand that taking a TA job actually means helping people and not making them feel idiotic for asking questions. I understand that TAs are students as well, and sometimes they might be overwhelmed with their own work, relationship issues, and just life, but if you take a job to be a TA there is an understanding that you will need to put in double the effort in your job and not actually half ass it. Some you are getting paid, and your able to make your resume look good. TAs are basically the teachers of the class, how am I supposed to understand the concept if the person who is supposed to help me half asses their work.\n","date":"Nov 17, 2019, 3:28 PM"},{"content":"13358 - That Latino Rager was probably the littest party I have been to at this school.

She has been complicit when it comes to his vile anti-Semitic and homophobic comments in a way that undermines the intersectional causes she otherwise espouses. \n\nYet have any of you really wondered why she and Tamika Mallory have chosen to work with Nation of Islam, besides being quick to assume that POC don't care about anti-Semitism? \n\nSarsour and Mallory have worked for decades in some of America's most forsaken areas. These areas aren't even on the radar most white liberals, and in some cases, they are the places where the NOI is strongest—earning sympathy for their work against poverty and violence even if people reject the NOI's anti-Semitism. Even Rahm Emanuel, the first Jewish mayor of Chicago, has acknowledged this, crediting them for reducing violence in Chicago, while Ta-Nehisi Coates (who white liberals love) has praised Farrakhan's disregard for the opinions of the white establishment. Activists like Sarsour and Mallory have often had to work with the NOI just due to proximity, and they might remember Farrakhan more as the person behind the Million Man March than for the press's occasional interest in his anti-Semitic comments. (Why do you think Obama of all people posed for a picture with him?)\n\nStill, Farrakhan is a vile anachronism, and under his leadership the NOI is just a shadow of its former self. Sarsour’s refusal to denounce him is discrediting when she is trying to lead an intersectional, nation-wide movement. It’s difficult to renounce those one once worked with, but Sarsour has made the wrong choice in this regard. \n\nBut it is a stunning hypocrisy for the Zionists on this page to fault her for that. Many of you regularly defend the establishment of a state that was founded through the ethnic cleansing of indigenous people (how else does one get a Jewish majority state in Palestine?), where hundreds of thousands were forced out of their homes to refugee ghettos across the middle east. This is supposedly just a sacrifice necessary to establish a Jewish state—yet those of you so willing to sacrifice people you’ve never met would never even set foot in one of the neighborhoods the NOI works in. There have even been recent threads (11680) where Zionists have listed various indigenous lands like a goddamn menu, debating the climate and real estate without a care for the people they know they would displace. You know your pro-Israel and anti-Divest activism enables the Occupation, yet you keep doing it, even as just this week the IDF has slaughtered dozens in cold blood. (And how many IDF veterans has BSI hosted?)\n\nYes, Sarsour is flawed, but she is one of the most famous Palestinian-Americans alive, bravely speaking out at a time when pro-Palestinian politics are woefully underrepresented (and simply limiting aid to Israel—the same weapons killing families in Gaza right now—is somehow considered progressive). Seeing the way some of you so casually dismiss those seeking to reduce Palestinian suffering as anti-Semitic, it’s also no wonder Sarsour has made comments questioning how that label is often applied. \n\nFor those of you who don’t consider yourselves Zionsits—great! None of this applies to you, and as far as I know you have every right to question this decision on the part of SJP. But for those of you who are Zionists, you might want to show a little more sympathy to those like Sarsour and SJP who are making difficult decisions for a cause they believe in. \"\n","date":"Nov 17, 2019, 3:06 PM"},{"content":"13299 - to the people at jo's who left all their trash on their tables after they left: clean up after yourselves. the caucasity...\n","date":"Nov 17, 2019, 3:06 PM"},{"content":"13298 - the lgbtq+ event led by mpc’s in leung tonight was so amazing, you all did such a wonderful job\n","date":"Nov 17, 2019, 3:06 PM"},{"content":"13297 - It’ll get better.

She has close ties to Louis Farrakhan, a man who has said “The Jews were responsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out: turning men into women, and women into men” among dozens of other atrocious comments that spew hate at the LGBTQ+ and Jewish communities (for more: https://www.adl.org/education/resources/reports/nation-of-islam-farrakhan-in-his-own-words ). While Sarsour has condemned his comments, she has repeatedly praised him and his organization, spoken at his rallies, and defended others for attending his speeches. Many people believe she and other original leaders of the Women’s March did not go far enough to distance themselves from this man, which made many people think twice about participating in the Women’s March. To me, anything less than completely severing ties with Farrakhan—and, honestly, not supporting him to begin with—is unacceptable. While I don’t expect every speaker at Brown to have a perfect history, I seriously question why Sarsour, of all people who could speak on the issue of Israel/ Palestine, was chosen. I would expect that, at a school that strives to protect the interests of students of all identities, someone even vaguely associated with such hate would not be selected as a speaker.

Don't get me wrong, I think everyone should get their HPV shots, but I guess what I am saying is that I also think everyone should use more protection or consider not sleeping with multiple partners without protection.

We've been going through some of the Dear Blueno/BBA posts regarding senior scramble, and we've seen a few common questions that we hope to answer:\n\n1. \"\"Will people be manually going through our form responses?\"\" No. In the interest of privacy and in the interest of saving us all a lot of manual labor, we've outsourced the matching process to a script that does the matching for us!\n\n2. \"\"I'm uncomfortable with giving such personal information to a random group of people, especially since I don't know if this is even a real matching service or if they just want to collect personal information.\"\" This is completely understandable, and something we've been thinking about a lot. Unfortunately, we have no way of 100% proving at this time that we're using the information from the form in the way it's supposed to be, but hopefully after this first round, you will hear about people who took the leap and ended up matching with others, and this might give you the sense that we really are just trying to help people out!\n\n3. \"\"Can there be a platonic version of senior scramble or a version of senior scramble for underclassmen?\"\" Potentially! After this first round, we will be posting a feedback form that we encourage you all to fill out in order to gauge where the senior scramble team should focus its efforts in future rounds. Platonic versions of senior scramble and senior scramble for underclassmen are both ideas that we are excited about potentially implementing!\n\nHopefully this was able to answer some questions you had about the senior scramble process. Don't forget that the form will close TOMORROW night at 11:59pm!! There are still so many people whose names have been submitted and who haven't filled out the form.

I haven't found an identifiable community of adoptees to share experiences or community with.\n\nAs an undergraduate in my senior year, I'm trying to start some discussions about the unique circumstances of adopted people or adoptees at Brown University and change the lack of support for adoptees at Brown.\n\nIf you are adopted, I'm hoping you'd fill out the survey to:\n1) help me get an informal sense of how many adopted people are here at Brown (it's not tracked by Brown in any way) and use this information to fight for some university recognition/funding/resources for adoptees\n2) contact me if you're interested in forming or getting involved in a student organization focused on providing adoptee community, fun activities, and a space for discussion about adoption or adoption-related things as they pertain to our lives.\n\nhttps://forms.gle/DtTrPF8ARXd2ZsAJA\"\n","date":"Oct 24, 2019, 10:41 PM"},{"content":"\"11947 - The real issue the government should be addressing:\nhttp://www.overcomingbias.com/2018/04/two-types-of-envy.html?fbclid=IwAR0d1FXNNeqYudpUQPM9iG3GUQERRYXKFtmfq9nyhJ7GcBfrxluv3M9uYDk\"\n","date":"Oct 24, 2019, 10:40 PM"},{"content":"11946 - Has anyone taken spring classes at risd?

I know it has a bad rap, and for good reason at times, but for me, I had no friends and was truly depressed at brown until I decided to rush a fraternity. Now I love brown, I can't wait to come back to school after every break and hang out and have fun with my friends. I had always considered myself a really normal person in high school. I liked to go out and loved to party, but I had no friends to go with at Brown. there was never really a chance for me to have a social outlet at this school until i rushed. I know it sounds lame, but there is really something to be said about the bonding that occurs over a shared identity that is really just about camaraderie having fun. I always see comments here advising people who feel like they don't have friends that should join this club or that club, but for me, none of that ever worked. There's something different about clubs vs social organizations. I really think for kids like me, who knew nobody coming into this school, that greek life provided me with a home and a place where I felt like I could actually have fun. I really believe this campus should work towards making greek life more inclusive, affordable, and safe as opposed to pushing it off campus. The off-campus frats and sports houses always have the best parties and it seems like (at least some of them) really try to make things as safe as possible, even going so far as to show entrants a list of rules. Imagine how much safer people would feel if the school brought those houses back on campus.

If you have a candidate you like the #1 thing you can do is go vote for them because you won’t be changing any minds in the current political climate.

Just don’t lash out publicly at others for not supporting your candidate.

Because she said she was a woman of color, Harvard was able to pretend that it had a woman of color on the law school faculty, at a time when it was embroiled in a scandal for not hiring any non-white women. Warren, when confronted about this, has tried to change the subject, by insisting that she was hired for her merit rather than for her fraudulent racial claims. (We will leave aside the ugly way that this defense implies affirmative action hires are not merit-based.) She has never held herself accountable for the actual problem, which is that she helped Harvard legitimize not hiring non-white people, because they were able to claim that they already had an American Indian on staff.”\n\n“I don’t know if you’ve looked into Elizabeth Warren’s corporate consulting background before, but it’s not good. A Washington Post report suggested that it had received “little scrutiny” and that when fully exposed it could “offer her opponents fresh avenues for attack.” Warren, it said, had worked on far more corporate cases than she initially disclosed, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars on the side advising (among others) chemical companies, oil companies, banks, and insurers on how to navigate bankruptcy proceedings. In one case, Warren argued that an aircraft manufacturer should be shielded from liability for a deadly accident that killed a NASCAR star. (I can already see the attack ads now, featuring the deceased driver’s family, talking about how Elizabeth Warren says she is for the people but tried to keep them from getting compensation. Trump will probably have the driver’s widow in the audience at the debates.)\n\nThe Washington Post homed in on one particular case, in which Warren worked on behalf of Dow Chemical:\n\nOne of her most controversial clients was Dow Chemical, which she advised in the mid-1990s. A subsidiary that manufactured silicone-gel breast implants faced hundreds of thousands of claims from women who said their implants caused health problems. Dow Chemical denied that it played a role in designing or making the implants and sought to avoid liability as its subsidiary, Dow Corning, declared bankruptcy.”\"\n","date":"Oct 22, 2019, 3:35 PM"},{"content":"11778 - TO ORGO KIDS:\n\nWith ORGO exams out and no mean given to us by BASU, I have decided to create my own anonymous poll.\n\nPlease fill out the poll with your score- ALL RESPONSES ARE ANONYMOUS!

The “Israel” that stands on the true land of Israel today has lost sight of what it means to be a Jew and is profiting off of the unconditional support the US offers as well as the military-industrial complex whose current business isn’t just to defend Israel but now is committing unforgivable atrocities. Personally I still believe the land of Israel is the homeland of the Jews, and that the true Israel must continue to exist. As a Jew I am caught between a rock and a hard place. I do not condone the atrocities, but I can’t stand idly by while we as Jews are looked down upon because of this, and the necessity of a Jewish homeland is questioned as well. \n\nThere continues to be a false equation of Jews and “Israel” on this campus. As Jews, we are not “Israel.” We should not want to be associated with “Israel,” the nation who is killing women and children and whose evil deeds have bloodied the cause for establishing and keeping the Jewish homeland. This true Israel, the dream of the Zionists, in which the Jews can remain and be safe in their holy lands of Jerusalem and surrounding territories, must continue to live on. The lines have been blurred. The “Israel” that kills has co-opted the dream of our people, seized power, and committed violence under the name of our homeland. The Israel that stands for everything good the Jewish people have lived for is an entity that has been overshadowed by “Israel.” This is the relationship between Israel and “Israel.” \n\nI am a Brown Student for Israel.

On top of just being a serious sucker for a good cocktail, I also just generally feel that cozy cocktail bars are happy places, and they make for really solid date spots after you hit 21. As people seemed to enjoy the little restaurant review I did last year (https://bit.ly/2FLDoQk), I thought I'd do a similar little review/ranking of the cocktail bars I've found too.\n\nBelow are mostly all the local bars I've been to while at Brown, generally ranked by how much I enjoyed them/want to go back/would suggest them for a date. Beneath the top 7 really strong picks, I've also broken down how relatively good each is in terms of its drinks and its ambiance.\n\nIf you have any favorites that aren't here, please drop them in the comments! I'm still have a few months left in PVD and I could use some fun new spots to get a lil tipsed! \n\nTHE DEAN BAR:\nA clear winner both in terms of ambiance and drink menu. A small, compact, and intimate space with gorgeous art painted onto the walls, The Dean Bar is just that sort of dimly lit spot that one feels like they might ~fall in love~ in, or something gross like that. In terms of drinks, the cocktail menu was truly phenomenal. My personal favorite was the Port Light, followed by their Mowgli’s Milk Punch, which is probably the most delightful milk punch I’ve ever had. (If you’ve never had a milk punch, try it! It’s amazing!) The second time I went, we were seated next to an older gentleman who let us know that his wife (Betsy) had designed the art for the walls. He highly recommends the espresso martinis.\n\nNote, the Dean is home to three bars: the bar in the restaurant North, The Boombox, and then The Dean Bar. To get to the bar, you walk into the hotel, go straight for a second until you see the restrooms, and then the bar will be to your left. If you get confused and end up in the wrong place though, the other two bars are pretty great too, so all is well!\n\nRank by Cocktail Quality: 1\nRank by Ambiance: 1\n\nCOURTLAND CLUB:\nThe Courtland Club has a good number of very quirky eclectic cocktails, most of which I found to be very solid and enjoyable. In truth, I don’t think its cocktails are quite on par with some of the contenders lower on the list, but it manages to beat out the others and score slot number two for its really fantastic vibe and aesthetic paired with a decent snack menu to boot. The bar area itself is gorgeous and feels pretty modern, but the area behind it where the tables are is essentially a very old home with well-worn brick walls, comfortable plush chairs, and an intimate cozy aura. A perfect spot for a good date.\n\nNote, the exterior just looks like a normal house, and it’s not on any sort of busy or commercial street, so you will likely feel like you’re in the wrong spot. Don’t worry! You’re probably not! I have a bit of a sweet tooth, so I enjoyed the Guava Mule and the Blended Coconut Toronto (a slushie of whiskey, fernet, pineapple, coconut, and cinnamon), but the Mother Theresa (a more bitter fruity mezcal drink) was also pretty good. For food, apparently the pizzas are *very* good. I only ever got other items which were pretty decent, but nothing phenomenal. When you’re done, the check comes in a little book in which past patrons have all written fun little notes and drawings in, which was an extra cute little bonus. \n\nAs a final note, to be adventurous, I got the “Forraje” which was a cocktail with mushrooms and champagne vinegar. I found it rather unpleasant and do not recommend you follow in my footsteps, but as they say, you live (laugh, love), and you learn :(\n\nRank by Cocktail Quality: 5\nRank by Ambiance: 2\n\nJUSTINE'S:\nA fun spot that’s very hard to find unless you know where to go, as the front room appears to be just a lingerie shop. Once you make it inside, however, it’s a very cozy place with a pretty strong selection of drinks. Not everything on the menu spoke to me, but then again, I wasn’t there to have everything on the menu. The three cocktails I tasted really hit the spot and were very well done (one of them that I can remember was the White Lighter, which was “Vida Mezcal, Giffard, Apricot Liquor, Carpano Bianco, and Lime Juice” -- it was just the right level of smokey and sweet).\n\nRank by Cocktail Quality: 4\nRank by Ambiance: 4\n\nTHE AVERY:\nSimilar to the Courtland Club, this bar nabs a high spot on the list largely for the amazing ambiance they’ve managed to create inside. The walls in particular are just really pleasant to look at. The cocktails here are a bit more standard, but still good. I also found the beer list to be pretty fun and even got a can of sake while I was there that I enjoyed a good bit. Also similar to the Courtland Club, this bar is in the middle of a neighborhood and its exterior looks like a house, so don’t be fooled!\n\nRank by Cocktail Quality: 7\nRank by Ambiance: 5\n\nTHE EAST END:\nI honestly just really fuck with The East End. For one, it’s one of the few quality cocktail bars that’s on college hill instead of requiring a trek into providence proper (It’s on Wickenden Street), and then also it just has a really strong cocktail menu. It’s not *quite* as aesthetic as the other bars, as it’s a good bit larger and you can tell it functions as a restaurant in the day, but they still manage to get the mood and the lighting pretty good. A solid date spot with all around good drinks.\n\nRank by Cocktail Quality: 3\nRank by Ambiance: 6\n\nFAR WEST:\nA very tiny hidden gem. The bar itself is small enough that the two times I went, I did have to wait a few minutes before room opened up for a party of two, but worth the wait. It’s nestled in an odd ware-housey building that also houses a Knead Doughnuts location, and to get in, you have to dial up the bar on a buzzer outside and have them buzz you in. Once inside, the bar itself is in what used to be an old factory vault. Cool vibes. I didn’t fully fall in love with the drinks, but I think that it was largely just the menu they had at the time (It was Area 51 themed for the raid -- I Imagine they’ve changed it up since). They also have some decent food, including a pretty cheap unlimited flavored popcorn.\n\nRank by Cocktail Quality: 6\nRank by Ambiance: 3\n\nTHE EDDY:\nThe Eddy probably deserves to be a bit higher on this list, as it does really have a nice ambiance and its cocktail menu is very strong (stronger than The Avery’s and Courtland Club’s), but somehow, it never quite calls to me in the same way. (I think it’s the large windows that look out onto the street that somehow break the vibe for me). That being said, it truly is a pretty phenomenal bar and it’s very hard to order wrong here -- I even enjoyed the drink where the dominant flavor was yellow bell-pepper. If you’re chiefly concerned with the cocktail quality, this is a strong choice.\n\nRank by Cocktail Quality: 2\nRank by Ambiance: 7\n\nBefore moving on, it's also worth a note that when I ate at The Dorrance, the cocktail selection was really quite stellar. I know you can also go there just to sit at the bar. I've never done so as it just seems one or two steps too fancy for a normal night out on the town, but were I to go back and sit at the bar, it'd almost certainly rank here in the top 8.\n\n**OTHER GOOD PICKS**\nThe following are either not traditional cocktail bars, or not quite as knock-your-socks off as the 7 above.\n\nFORTNIGHT WINE BAR:\nIs it a cocktail bar? No. But I fuck with it. Their snacks are really good, their wine is really good, and I like the space they’re in too. I have enjoyed every date I’ve had here quite a bit, and the bartenders are always just really cool.\n\nFREE PLAY ARCADE BAR:\nWhile we’re going against genre, I’ll put this gem here. I honestly want to put this spot much higher on the list, but it felt wrong to put an arcade bar high on my cocktail bar ranking. The truth is, however, that this is probably the most fun first-date spot there can be. The games are good. If you enjoy a sweet cocktail, the drinks here are pretty typical of what you’ll find at arcade bars and are done very well, and if you over-imbibe a bit, if you resign yourself to the incredible heart-burn you’ll wake up with, the pizzas are a great way to get some drunk-food into your belly.\n\nNORTH:\nAs a restaurant, North is just about my favorite spot in Providence. It also has a pretty stellar bar with some fun drinks, but it closes at midnight, and you do get the distinct sense you’re in the bar-part of a restaurant rather than being in a bar, which is mainly why it doesn’t nab a spot higher on the list. That in mind though, I’ve generally enjoyed the cocktails I’ve gotten here -- they rotate pretty quickly, save for the few staples that never change like their red wine mixed with cola (quirky, but was admittedly not worth it compared to the other drinks.) They also have a pretty fun sake menu, and pretty extensive wine list as well.\n\nTHE GRADUATE CENTER BAR:\nWill I get canceled if I put the GCB this low? I don’t know. In truth, I love the good-ol’ guh-cuh-buh. I went there undeniably far too much last year. But lately it has lost some of its allure now that I know there are so many awesome cocktail spots around, and I never got around to renewing my membership this year. Price wise, pretty much nothing will beat the GCB in terms of bang-for-buck on cocktails, and the selection is pretty solid all around. It’s definitively more divey and less cocktail bar-y though, so we’re putting it down here.\n\nBOOMBOX:\nI only went here for a single drink after hitting the Dean Bar, as they’re right next to one another in the same building, so I didn’t get to really check it out fully, but it was fun! It’s a karaoke bar, and the one drink we did get was in a little kitty-shaped mug and was sweet and honestly really good! Planning to go back at some point to get a little ~mischievous~ and maybe sing Promiscuous. \n\nSLOW RHODE:\nI was only here once and it was the final stop of the night for me, and if we’re being honest, my memory of it is slightly hazy. It was, however, the final stop because it was the only fun bar spot serving food really late into the night, and we both decided we really needed a snack. The cocktail menu is small but the drink we got was very good, and the duck gravy fries we got were exactly what we needed to begin the process of being humans again. Its low ranking is largely because it felt a bit more like a restaurant than a bar, combined with me only having tried one drink there and having it be a slightly hazy experience. Seemed cool though!\n\n**HONORABLE MENTIONS**\n\nTHE MALTED BARLEY:\nA lot of really good sweeter cocktails, and if you’re in the mood for a snack, a lot of really fun pretzelly foods. Feels more like a bar than a restaurant, but definitively not intimate date vibes or cocktail bar vibes. A good spot to go out with friends to, or on a chiller date.\n\nTHE ROSENDALE:\nHonestly, ~really~ solid cocktail menu, but it’s more of a wings-n-burgers restaurant interior than a cool cocktail burger interior. Probably not the go-to date spot, but a good place to go with some friends for solid drinks. \n\nSAINT MONDAYS:\nCocktail menu didn’t wow me: Mostly just all classic drinks, and all of them were pretty citrusy. Also was pretty big inside and didn’t have the best vibe, personally, but I’d still consider it good and worth checking out.\n\nTHE RIVER SOCIAL:\nMostly cool because it’s right on the river, so it’s a great spot to grab a drink when waterfire is happening. The majority of the room is a bar, but it still feels a bit more like a restaurant than a bar proper. Cocktails were pretty decent.\n\nXACO TACO:\nDefinitely more of a restaurant than a bar, but a fun spot! Cocktails are honestly pretty great, and who doesn’t want a good taco while having some cocktails! Cool!\n\nHIGH TIDES TIKI BAR:\nAcross the street from Xaco Taco, the two of them make a good pair if you’re on a bar crawl adventure. The drinks here are pretty enjoyable if you’re into the classic sugary cocktails typical of tiki bars. \n\nTHE DISTRICT:\nThis was the final stop of one of my larger bar crawls. The memory of it is rather fuzzy and I only had it in me to try one cocktail there, but it was very good! It was a smooth sweet green colored pistachio cocktail that made me think “Wow, maybe I should come back here some time when I can fully enjoy this experience.” I never did, as it’s a bit of a trek from me now and the ambiance really wasn’t great (also mainly a restaurant), but worth checking out nonetheless!\n\nBAR LOUIE:\nOnly went briefly, and in the daytime, but seemed like your standard sports bar. Overall solid drink menu. \n\nHOT CLUB:\nDidn’t feel like anything to write home about, but a pleasant experience nonetheless. It had a cocktail menu, but felt more like a dive bar in spirit.\n\nHope this is useful to some of you and that you manage to get off college hill and explore a lil bit! As mentioned before, please drop anything I missed in the comments. I'm also hoping to do this one last time with bars and restaurants right before I graduate and leave. Please wish me luck in finding good spots to grab cocktails and food. \n\nHappy Drinking, and Cheers!\n\"\nUpdated Oct 18, 2019, 8:06 PM\n","date":"Oct 18, 2019, 8:06 PM"},{"content":"\"11629 - As a proud member of the National Association of Rail Passengers, I am very troubled by all the negative discourse about NARPs and non-NARPs on this website :(\n.\n.\n.\n(BTW a student membership to NARP is only $20/year, which gets you a 10% discount on Amtrak travel!

Poor Black and brown people are still getting locked up for selling, using, or even being suspected of having drugs. Meanwhile, students at Brown can publicly consume drugs and illicit substances without so much as a ticket, and on top of that, had the support of the University through this harm reduction program.

If the CCP gives in to the youth of Hong Kong, they’ll have to give in to all their other citizens who want a share of the power pie and because I don’t see the CCP transitioning peacefully into a democracy anytime soon, that’ll lead to some pretty serious political instability.

There are other paths forward as well...

Right now I just see a lot of denial from the “privileged” population in China who dismiss people who disagree as “western brainwashed meddling,” and repeat propaganda without trying to break any of it down because I’m sure a lot of you only see the elements of truth to the arguments and don’t even realize that the other half is all just propaganda to maintain the power of the CCP (yeah America does have a history of criticizing China for its own ends but those arguments also still stem from a place of truth)\n\nAlso if we’re gonna have this discussion, I suggest we have it on Facebook and not wechat bc spoiler alert wechat is monitored by the CCP and Facebook is not.

From what I've seen, it's also virtually the entirety of Pacific Asia: Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Mongolia, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka. \n\nWhy so many grievances from so many people across the world? Perhaps, just maybe, it's because these grievances were never about \"\"anti-mainland brainwashing.\"\" Maybe we do know what we are talking about.\n\nYou claim \"\"the government wants nothing but success and strong morals for its people\"\" (although, if they really wanted to achieve the people's interests, they wouldn't have defied the voices of millions in Tiananmen and murdered thousands of its own people. But I digress.) but you fail to realize that this line of thinking is the crux of the issue. \n\nWhat does it take to achieve \"\"the good for the nation?\"\" It entails subjugating the Uyghurs to concentration camps, sterilizing them and destroying their cultural land; it entails kidnapping, assaulting and murdering dissents in Hong Kong and imposing authoritarian values to an otherwise democratic city; it entails using its position of power to delegitimize Taiwan; it entails promoting vengeful nationalism through vilification of Western nations and using the \"\"Century of Humiliation\"\" narrative; it entails using its position of power to forcibly control territory, such as the Nine Dashed Line in South East Asia; it entails using its economic power and debt-trap diplomacy to exploit Kenya, Zambia and Djibouti and seize their national infrastructure and natural resources, solely for the benefit of Chinese companies and at the expense of those nation's citizens; it entails promoting the rejection of democratic values and civil liberties, such as in Latin America by exporting surveillance technology to authoritarian parties in the region.\n\nThe Communist Party of China presents to the world that it does not rule by law or justice. It rules by power and violence. Mainland Chinese interests (and more importantly, the Party's interests) are prioritized at the expense of everyone else's interests. They are achieved through any means possible, through invasive and controlling methods that violate human rights and international laws. Anyone who opposes is suppressed, through harassment and violence.\n\nIt stands for everything Brown University and its people have fought against, and Brown (and the West in general) is right to continue fighting against it. Doing so is not \"\"bias,\"\" \"\"fueling anti-mainland sentiment\"\" or \"\"fueling false news\"\"; it is seeking justice in the same way we seek justice in our own governments.\n\n---\n\nPost script. On the Hong Kong issue.\n\nI witnessed the Umbrella Movement back in 2014 when I was in Hong Kong. Although I am in Brown now, some of my friends go to college in Hong Kong and live there. Some of my friends live outside elsewhere, but head back to Hong Kong frequently because they have family there. What they tell me is largely the same.\n\nThere is so much that I can write about, on the topic of whether foreign intervention is involved, of the demographics of the protestors, of the brutality of the police. I can elaborate in another post, but what I most urgently want to say right now is this:\n\nPlease educate yourself. Read up on the Civil Rights Movement, on the 1989 democracy movement in China, and on the democratization movements in Taiwan and South Korea. They all have unnerving parallels with the current movement in Hong Kong. You question why the protestors in Hong Kong are all \"\"brainwashed young people,\"\" but the protestors in Tiananmen, too, were largely led by students in Beijing. They, too, were accused of \"\"being brainwashed with Western ideals and values.\"\" They, too, were disillusioned and angry about how the values of people's rights touted by the nation did not match up with the corrupt, authoritarian realities they were living in. It's not exactly a new phenomenon. \n\nYour bold claims make it clear that you have little to no idea on the nature of the protests, nor did you spend time to think about why the protestors are doing what they are doing. You clearly have not been to Hong Kong, nor do you have any evidence (first-hand or second-hand) to back up your claims. \n\nInstead, you chose to end up in the same pitfalls that others in history have fell in: hatred, dismissal, and generalization. Ironic that you accuse the \"\"West\"\" of spouting \"\"brainwashed media,\"\" yet you yourself present an incredibly myopic view of the situation, parroting the exact same lines the Chinese news media outlets speak of. \n\nAs others have said, you're in Brown. You're smart. You can do better.\"\n","date":"Oct 15, 2019, 1:53 PM"},{"content":"11366 - Ain’t no heat in young o tho\n","date":"Oct 15, 2019, 1:53 PM"},{"content":"11365 - why are the answer guides for the orgo packets not actual fucking answers but literally textbook pages ??????\n","date":"Oct 15, 2019, 1:53 PM"},{"content":"\"11364 - topics: china, hong kong\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nIn response to 11303:\nFirst, let’s condemn violence and condemn violence on ALL sides. You can’t turn a blind eye to police violence. Put aside the wounded protestors for a moment, how are you going to defend the police use of force when an Indonesian journalist was shot with rubber bullet right on the face and was blinded in one eye because of that? Can you still proudly share People Daily’s meme that says “I support Hong Kong police and now you can beat me. What a shame for Hong Kong.” Can you? \n\nIf you do believe there’s absolutely nothing wrong on the police side, then I guess we have very little room for further conversations. \n\nSecond, you’re arguing that Hong Kong’s protest and Western media’s coverage is undermining China’s sovereignty and values. Do you actually read over the protestors’ five demands? \n1. Complete withdrawal of the extraction bill.\n2. Retract the characterization of “riots” on June 12 protest\n3. Release arrested protestors without charges \n4. Independent investigation into police violence \n5. Implementation of full universal suffrage\n\nAfter Hong Kong people taking to the streets for consecutive weeks, the SAR government finally agreed to meet the first demand but still refused to meet the rest four. In what sense do you think China’s sovereignty and values will be determined, if all five demands are met? None of these is related with Hong Kong independence.\n\nAnd I’m pretty sure, as a Brown-educated student with some conscience, protesting against the government for its attempt to pass a legislation that sends its people to a judicial regime lack of transparency and embracing human rights/freedom/democracy is in one of our values. \n\nThird, there’s actually nothing to do with Taiwan here, but since you mentioned it, I wanted to take this chance to reply to you. You said “the West attempts to fuel anti-mainland sentiment in Taiwan.” Could you provide some proofs to support your argument? \n\nOn the other hand, when I read how the West is covering Taiwan’s news, I always feels that the West has, instead, been very careful not to irritate China on reporting Taiwan. For example, when Taiwan passed same-sex marriage legalization earlier this year, the West mainstream media reported it as “first in Asia” and almost every outlet avoided using the term “country” in their coverage. \n\nAnd I guess it’s just fundamentally hard for Taiwanese people nowadays to align themselves to the Chinese identity, especially when Taiwanese people have the right to go to the polls to elect their own President every four year and celebrate their National Day on Oct 10 not on Oct 1. Does this really have anything to do with the West? \n\nHowever, if you do strongly think Taiwan is a province of China and that you do champion LGBT rights like the majority of Brown student does, you can help by doing something very simple: march through the streets in China to pressure every other province to follow Taiwan’s same-sex marriage legalization. \n\nFourth, a bit off tangent here but what’s your take on the concentration camp in Xinjiang where a million of Muslims is detained? Do you really think it’s just piece of fake news conspired by the West in order to demonize China? If yes...this is very unfortunate and it’ll make me feel very sad that my one of fellow Brown students thinks this way. \n\n\"\n","date":"Oct 15, 2019, 1:53 PM"},{"content":"11363 - What do you do when you forget to turn in homework and the professor has a no late policy...\n","date":"Oct 15, 2019, 1:53 PM"},{"content":"11362 - Anyone else feel like they have no friends?

The sheer confidence they espouse when throwing around loaded/politicized concepts and “facts” whose underlying meaning and circumstances they neither understand nor care to find out is utterly astonishing. For people who claim tolerance as a fundamental virtue, who boast of their acceptance and embracement of differences in the world, who preen themselves on their cosmopolitan wokeness, to uphold one set (their set) of values, institutions, practices, and way of life to be the universal standard is a paradox of the highest order. They never pause to consider whether certain concepts have been made into rhetorical weapons, whether double standards are practiced in the characterization of certain events, whether extremely complex circumstances have been crystallized into one punchy narrative that completely ignores its vast underside. It is high time that we truly appreciate and celebrate the diversity in our world, by suppressing the danger of the single story, by listening humbly and attentively to the voices of the other side, by acknowledging, above all, that there are institutions, cultures, and ways of life dramatically different from those of ours, yet whose right to exist is no less legitimate. \nThe problems surrounding Hong Kong have deep and intricate roots. They can only be resolved through the cooperation of all sides. Violence, especially the chaotic rioting that we have witnessed in recent weeks, is simply not conducive to any resolution. Ultimately, however, these problems are China’s internal problems. The extent to which sinister foreign forces have been involved in inciting violence and buttressing it with tons and tons of money have revealed in the clearest possible terms their subversive intentions. As a sovereign nation whose sovereignty over Hong Kong is indubitable, China ought to have the right to decide on the best path forward, and to do so without undue foreign intervention. \nAs a final note: every former colony, after the retreat of its former imperial master, has gone through a process of decolonization that seeks to remove or transform the imposed social-political institutions and ideologies. Hong Kong, however, is an exception. It has largely maintained British colonial practices in all areas of governance and all walks of life, to the extent that foreign judges still sit on its courts and its younger generations still feel greater attachment to the former imperial master after twenty-two years.

The West has always been afraid of China and challenged our rights. In fact, the American government and its allies make China out as an enemy. Thus, you that have never lived in China cannot take an educated view. Hong Kong’s people have long been whitewashed due to being controlled by their colonizers, the British. Ever since the territory became one with China again, the West has fueled false news and angst against the mainland. Just as the West attempts to fuel anti-mainland sentiment in China’s Taiwan Province. The media makes it seem like everyone in Hong Kong is protesting, but it is only a small amount of youth influenced by the West who are destroying their economy and disrupting day to day activities. They are attacking Police and anyone who disagrees with them as well as vandalizing innocent people’s businesses.

This has not been the case at all. I’ve warmed up to stances that I once viewed as extreme. I’m now unapologetically supportive of many of the progressive policies I once laughed at. But why did I shift left and not right? I think the answer says a lot about Brown. If I had encountered progressives who shamed, isolated, “cancelled,” less liberal individuals, I most certainly would’ve reacted negatively to that. All it takes is a quick YouTube search to find tons of examples of what I’m talking about. But as progressive as they are, Brown students aren’t like that. They present compelling arguments backed by logic, data, and/or real-life examples. Rather than being overloaded with the “SJW rhetoric” that the Ben Shapiro crowd talks about, I was doused with damning evidence demonstrating that my moderate views were painfully weak and cowardly. This isn’t to say that conservatives and moderates are objectively wrong. I’m glad we have them on campus, and most genuinely believe in their perspective and can defend their stances well.

Sometimes if i feel i've messed up talking to someone or embarrassed myself I'll feel compelled to rush back to my dorm and start cutting in order to relieve my frustration. I've self harmed regularly since high-school, i never thought much of it and have come to consider it a pretty normal thing, but my recent increase in this activity has kinda reminded me of the fact it can be harmful. \n\n2) the previous point's tied to my anxiety which has grown pretty bad, and pretty much prevented me from making any friends for the few years i've been here. When people show me even a little bit of attention or interest I feel really delighted, but can never really bring it past a casual conversation. I try to be as affable as possible, but I feel that there's always some disconnect which prevents me from connection with others on a deeper level. It may also be that I'm afraid of overstepping my boundaries, or revealing parts of myself that I'm insecure about. I even get anxious over the thought of another person finding out that after three years here I don't have friends -- cause that would maybe come off as weird, right? Maybe I set unrealistic expectations for myself, but in any case it's hard to fight the nagging feeling that those expectations are reality\n\n3) In high-school I was in a pretty dark place and did some things im not proud of, and since that period in my life I've been actively trying to better myself by joining clubs, interacting with more people, and pursuing my passions. And though I've accomplished those things on a superficial level, I feel like I haven't changed much from the person I was in high school either. No matter what I do, I'm still facing the same mental barriers and retreating to the same methods of escape. For those reasons I feel like I'm never going to mature and get the things I want from life, and that's what probably frustrates me the most. Like, even if i was to drop school and move to another country or change my identity, i would still be me, and the fact i cant change anything about that feels unbearable at times\"\n","date":"Oct 8, 2019, 9:36 PM"},{"content":"11158 - Has anyone who interviewed for McKinsey's DC office heard back yet?

Not every poor family needs food stamps. Not every poor young person wants to go to college. Not every poor person works a minimum wage job. By giving people cash, you empower them to make decisions that will actually better their lives. Maybe that means fixing a guy’s car so he can take that higher paying job a few towns over.

This post is somewhat a response to topics discussed recently here on dear blueno, but I guess it's more generally just letting out my frustration with a bunch of shit. I also don't know how long these are allowed to be or whether anyone will read this entire thing, but a fuck i do not give. Here goes:\n\nFirst of all, regarding post 10791 from earlier today: I didn't really agree with anything OP had to say, but the comments were kind of fucky. Most notably were those that were attempting to passive aggressively discredit the argument because of the fact that it was made anonymously. You know who you are, and I'm pretty sure these were bait, or maybe they're just farming reddit gold, but just in case there are ever some that aren't let me be very clear:\n\nAnonymity is absolutely pivotal in today's society. Undermining someone's ability to say what they like without the potential aforementioned character judgment is effectively shutting down an argument based on the medium by which it is argued and is therefore a fallacious judgment of character in and of itself. It also raises the question of why you're looking at dear blueno to begin with. Get off your high horses with this pseud-tier \"\"you're anonymous, therefore pussi xD\"\" shit. College campuses can be home to some of the most divisive and controversial discussion in the world, and it's your responsibility as a student to let it take place in all its forms without letting your emotions get the better of you. Allow people to express themselves however they choose (obviously within reason), and either bring something of value to the conversation or say nothing at all.\n\nTo quote Chris Poole (no, I'm not a fucking idiot, thanks for asking), \"\"We're moving towards social networking, we're moving towards persistent identity, we're moving towards a lack of privacy... and in doing so, we're losing something valuable.\"\"\n\nThat thing of value that we have the potential to lose is freedom of expression without prudence; which I would argue is vital in driving the world forward.\n\nAlso a side note on this topic, and sort of going back to what I said at the beginning about partisanship; although it's understandably difficult, evaluating an argument not as a whole but as a collection of smaller ideas is much more worthwhile than the former. Just because you consider yourself X and you're not supposed to agree with Y doesn't mean that there can't be some overlap in your ideologies. Have an open mind, don't play sides. For example, me putting \"\"op likes reddit and soy\"\" at the top of this may have made this entire post seem retarded to some of you, and it would be my hope that instead of this way of thinking you could find value in other parts of it. Don’t give in to your own confirmation bias. This is a problem I see all the time and it is so, so goddamn annoying. \n\nNext I want to talk about cultural appropriation. Before watching you all argue about this shit, I honestly had no idea what it was and I kind of thought it was a 4chan social experiment or something. I've been doing research for a couple hrs so hopefully this is coherent, I'll first try to give my own take on it then talk about some posts here.\n\nFirst, I wanna define cultural appropriation as I understand it so this has a foundation of some kind. Feel free to correct me if I’m wrong about this definition, it’s important to agree on stuff like this beforehand so it doesn’t just devolve into an argument about semantics, which is boring as shit. There were also some complaints that some OPs didn’t understand what cultural appropriation was to begin with, so it’s probably easier to get this out of the way.\n\nSimply put, it seems that cultural appropriation is when one culture adopts ideas or practices from another. As to what culture is, I like this definition that I found online: “the characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people”. In this case, a culture is less a group of people and more an entity that embodies a certain set of ideas, which is the definition I’d prefer to go with. And to appropriate is to take without permission and use for one’s own purposes. I saw some mentioning of the idea of cultural misappropriation, but I think it makes more sense to group the two together into a single concept of cultural appropriation. Now for my thoughts.\n\nVery, very generally speaking, I believe that cultural appropriation is not inherently bad or good. It just is. I suppose getting a little deeper into it I’d lean towards it being a good thing, as we are, in fact, people. \n\nHumanity is beautiful in its perfections, imperfections, and everything in between, and by culturally landlocking yourself you are subverting what it means to be human. Everything that we know and understand about ourselves, everything that we enjoy, and everyone we love is a product of the global spread of ideas that has been taking place since the beginning of time.\n\nI saw an interesting take in a Huffington Post article (jesus christ, I know it’s not a scholarly source but I’m not talking about any of the god-awful content, just one idea) which is that when it comes to cultural appropriation, people should go by the general rule of “celebrate, don’t appropriate”. It’s kind of cheesy, but it makes sense at first. But after thinking a bit about it, to this, I’d ask the question: are these two things not one in the same? Appropriation is celebration; the appropriated elements wouldn’t have been appropriated if they weren’t found to be interesting or moving in some way/shape/form. Conversely, celebration is appropriation; in fact, acknowledging that some element of culture even exists is appropriation, as you’re making yourself and others aware of it and letting it affect other aspects of your character and soul, and by extension your own culture. So I suppose that in order to be wholly against cultural appropriation, you have to be against all exchange of culture and therefore culture as a whole.\n\nA counter-argument: to the claim that appropriation is celebration, one might say that if you appropriate some element of culture for your own personal gain or to intentionally negatively affect the other party, that this is not a form of celebration. This will be controversial, but I’d argue that it is, in fact, celebration, and it requires going back to my point about humanity’s perfections and imperfections. It would be nice if we lived in a la-dee-da utopia, but we don’t, and we never, ever will. For our own sake, it’s necessary that our culture reflect this. Although it’s shitty for someone to take an idea and call it their own, that’s something that people will never stop doing. That concept is part of global culture, it is ingrained into each and every one of us. The existence of evil can’t be ignored. Thus, (and this is a little more philosophical/theoretical because idk that’s just how I rationalized this) we must not let ourselves become highly sensitized to the world’s problems. In fact, we have to celebrate them, learn from them, experience them, and keep moving forward. And on a cultural scale, this means letting things be as they must. Without cultural appropriation, jazz likely would never have left New Orleans, the modern hip-hop scene wouldn’t be nearly as prolific, the Spaghetti Western wouldn’t exist, the fields of philosophy and literature and any other art would be entirely stagnant, and so, so much more. You could definitely argue that if things were different it would be better or worse, but my argument is that, at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter. All of the things that people do, including cultural appropriation, are a part of culture, and these things are what make earth what it is at any given point in time. Advocating against cultural appropriation is advocating against the fundamentals of what separates us from animals: our meaningful interactions and relationships with one another on every scale. We are one species, we grow and change together; not separately.\n\nOn a side note: there are many topics in modern politics like the opposition to cultural appropriation that, although their intentions seem somewhat sound and wholesome, end up having the opposite effect of creating controversy and divisiveness where there previously was none or less. I hate seeing friends of mine no longer speak to each over shit like this. It’s retarded. Our objective should be to achieve unity, not alienation. Think about the implications of a movement you support before getting your pitchforks. \n\nPost 10793 from earlier is interesting. Most of the comments provided basically nothing of value or shit unfunny twitter reaction images that my mom might find good (aka, nothing of value), but there were a couple that at least had some meat on them that I want to talk about after OP's.\n\nI disagree with their initial statement about there being nothing wrong with cultural appropriation, because truthfully there is some level of wrong with everything, it's just a question of magnitude. As far as the rest of the post goes, it’s kind of articulated retardedly, and there’s an unnecessary mention of race and it’s overall a little hostile, but if you can see past that I think that this person shares some of my views on this topic.\n\nStarting with something that [redacted] mentioned about OP equating cultural appropriation and exchange, I’d ask him to refer to what I said above about celebration/appropriation and all that. I’d argue that these two things are the same. And if that’s not something you can agree with, then I think you may be able to agree that they are at least part of the same practice, they just differ in their extent. As for your first >le funny greentext, I completely agree. I don’t know why the fuck OP brought up race to begin with. I just hope that by this you don’t mean that cultural appropriation isn’t a global phenomenon that has an effect on all people, regardless of ethnicity of background, when this clearly is the case. And for your last >tfw, same as your second one, refer to above about humanity and evil, etc. And to add on to that, because I obviously do understand that cultural appropriation does stir up frustration with the party being appropriated, I think it’s important to address the short term vs. the long term (too tired to finish this argument someone else do it, \n\n[redacted] gave a good response and made a case for why cultural appropriation can be bad, and assuming that she would concede the fact that cultural appropriation can be both good and bad, I’d ask her to refer to what I said above about how it doesn’t really matter and both good and bad things are a part of the global process of evolution culturally, politically, artistically, and probably every other -ally there is (even if she doesn’t agree that it can be good, the bad alone can satisfy this argument). To expand upon the example I gave about the field of philosophy; that field thrives based off of taking ideas from one person, twisting it in your own way, and sending it back out into the world. And to relate this to the example you give about bindis, is it not the same idea? Taking something from someone else, spinning it in your own way, and showing it off. Call it bad, call it good, again, it doesn’t matter. It just is, and this is how the world is driven forward. And to get into this particular example, I’d argue that the appropriation of the bindi could be a beneficial thing. You mentioned that people wearing bindis can be the targets of ridicule. If a “coachella girl” (whatever the fuck that is) appropriates the bindi and makes it trendy, would that not save some legitimate bindi wearers from said ridicule? I’m kind of tired so this might not make any sense, bear with me pls. I’d be interested to hear your thoughts.\n\nFor what cultural appropriation is interpreted as here on campus, [redacted] makes a good point too. But this goes back to creating unnecessary divisiveness: it would be (hopefully inarguably) better if the world could see past race and instead of having white culture, black culture, etc, just have culture. But maybe I’m thinking too idealistically. Maybe there is no escape from separating people into categories, and I’m actually just a big fucking retard. Lmk\n\nI’ve become very tired now, i will sleep soon\n\nAdditionally, nobody addressed what I thought anon’s strongest point was, which was that cultural appropriation brings people together. Again, my argument for that is above. [redacted] kind of started to bring it up, but instead he just accused OP of not knowing what the fuck he was talking about which was stupid, you could have blessed op with a definition. I’d love to hear some arguments to this because I’m very interested in this topic\n\n*this took a lot longer than I expected, ty for reading I wanted to talk about the trump flag thing but that can wait, I have to study for a thing and sleep, I’ll do it tomorrow, big kek, follow my soundcloud*\n\n–A\"\n","date":"Oct 3, 2019, 2:33 PM"},{"content":"10832 - is there any library/study space or whatever with imacs on campus?\n","date":"Oct 3, 2019, 2:32 PM"},{"content":"10831 - Hot take all food offered at Brown / events at Brown should be at least vegetarian fight me\n","date":"Oct 3, 2019, 2:32 PM"},{"content":"10830 - I’m debating doing the masters in public health program at Brown, but I’m hesitant because that means I would be at Brown for another year without my friends and I’m not sure if I can get financial aid either.

The combination of the football posts and the Trump flag posts has shown me there’s actually a huge overlap between the people defending the football team and the people not just defending but supporting the Trump flag. These people tend to be large white males with low-emotion stares in their profile pics. Their cover photo is usually them with an arm wrapped around another large white male, with an American flag or sports field in the background. Their sentences are usually structured in a simplistic way, with some fancy words thrown in there, not necessarily in the right context.\n\nAnd to make sure I’m addressing all sides (so that no one likes me), there’s definitely some common themes among progressive commenters. “Problematic,” “toxic,” and “that’s a lot to unpack” are common words/phrases. Usually their profile pic is them smiling almost too much, as leaves fall around them, or maybe they’re in a sunflower field. They often use memes and write long rebuttals to moderate claims that aren’t particularly controversial.\n\nCentrists usually wear suits or other mainstream clothing in their pro pics, defend free speech a lot, clarify that they do not like Trump, and generally have points of view that aren’t very compelling but are also too subtle to be rebutted.\"\n","date":"Oct 3, 2019, 2:31 PM"},{"content":"10828 - Hello!

They don't support racism, they don't agree with his racism. Likewise for sexism, xenophobia, islamophobia, etc. The reason they support Trump is because they think that delicate issues (including social issues) CANNOT be effectively handled by the federal government. The government has an absurd amount of waste every year, and policies that the vast majority of Americans agree upon still fail to get passed. \nThe point of the Republican party is to encourage all those that don't like how things are done on the national level to be able to take up those issues and choose for yourself how to deal with them on a local level. Want more affordable housing? Talk to the Providence city council. Want to help those who are starving? Donate to local churches or food banks. Want to reduce racism? Volunteer at campaigns that bring people of different races together. This will do much more than your vote for president ever will. \nOf course Trump has done lots of things that you believe are bad for the country. But please just take a second to recognize that those things aren't objectively bad—your opinion of those being bad comes from your perspective/background/experiences, and given other experiences you could easily say that even though it's horrible that Trump promotes racism, he's still doing more good for society than harm. Sometimes Brown gets so obsessed with preventing people from being triggered or offended that it forgets there are things more important than not being offended: discovering truth, growing both socially and financially as a nation, and progressing science, among other things.

Take the party bus a group of girls my year got for the Harvard-Brown game. They are legit too important to ride the normal people buses. More importantly, an invite to this special club meant being in the friend group, which requires having important parents. You can't justify this by saying \"\"so what, if they're wealthy they can do what they want with their money\"\" because most Brown students are no stranger to wealth. The barrier to entry is extreme wealth and parental connections, not just enough wealth to go on fancy vacations. They are on a completely different level of problematic.\n\nI don't completely blame the girls for doing this, especially because every year has a friend circle that implicitly has an \"\"important parent application.\"\" In other words, this isn't an isolated incident. Even though you can Google the net worth of everyone's parents on that bus, I can find you photos of 10-person parties where every invite is the child of celebrity-level wealth or connections or both. These parties are not the granoff dinners! They are set up by Brown students! Can you imagine.\n\nAnyway, Brown is partially responsible for creating this culture through admissions. Some may argue that donations in admissions are important for financial aid and whatnot. So then why not make it a competition for the 20 highest bidding families to receive admission this route? Admission is already bought under the table, so why not get each individual donation to be as high as possible, choose the highest, and pollute the student body a little less? The rest can get in if they genuinely contribute something as an individual, which is highly possible given the opportunities these people have. If there's a better solution to this problem, I wouldn't be surprised. Not saying mine is perfect by any means. The main thing I'm trying to convey is the really classist problem Brown creates for itself.\n\nI'm just sick of the next-level wealthy people waltzing right in with their attitudes of doing whatever they want, while being in a student body that should be somewhat socially aware and intelligent. It seems extremely tone deaf to me, and is a reason Brown is not as incredible as it could be. Like this school is so wonderful, yet there are pockets of people Brown smuggles in through admissions that make this place feel commoditized and corporate. Since not all wealthy people are like this, it's a reflection of truly how many seats Brown sets aside for people with parents like this. There's enough for exclusive cults to exist in an institution where people are also doing serious work for the better social good. What a juxtaposition. \"\n","date":"Sep 30, 2019, 3:37 PM"},{"content":"10588 - are elephant pants cultural appropriation?\n","date":"Sep 30, 2019, 3:37 PM"},{"content":"\"10587 - Hey you!

This page will ALWAYS do more harm than good. It’s like none of you have ever used an anonymous online forum. Also everyone who says “yeah but my comments will help people change their minds about problematic things” - no they won’t. This page is genuinely just an echo chamber and even if people read posts on here it won’t change their minds about anything. (Even this post won’t change your mind.) Truly this page should have been like a “Dear Abby” thing where people ask for advice instead of allowing for discourse on problematic things because that discourse will never do anything positive to change things. Additionally, SO many of you immediately jump down the throat of a post you don’t agree with and say pretty nasty things to them. Have you considered maybe having the benefit of the doubt because they might not have had the same privileged upbringing as you to know about some things? Tbh when people drag each other on here for whatever reason it’s mostly just to get whatever dumb internet brownie points they want for dragging them the hardest and getting the most likes instead of being patient and kind and explaining respectfully. Listen, I get it. I’m a queer WOC - am I tired of having to explain to people when they’re being problematic or have a problematic outlook on some of my identities? OF COURSE I AM. But if I’ve learned anything about having kind conversations with misguided people is that those people are definitely willing to learn if you give them a chance. This forum is not the place for these kind of discussions because OPs have no accountability for what they post and are likely to stick to their guns a lot more and because comments replying back to them are usually aggressive instead of compassionate. Am I advocating to excuse ignorant behavior? No. I’m saying if you want people to actually change their minds and learn then you have to be patient (in a time when nobody has any patience left - nobody said it would be easy). This is not even to say of the hundreds of posts that get posted here of people replying to certain OPs or commenters and utterly ripping them apart or calling them stupid or ridiculous or otherwise making fun of them. Dear Blueno says it doesn’t allow for people to directly target others but this is clearly directed. It’s cyberbullying and none of you are learning how to communicate effectively and compassionately with anyone who disagrees with you. This is a lot of the reason why conservative media paints liberals as crying special snowflakes because nobody is willing to consider why someone might think a certain way before they jump right down their throats. C’mon y’all - do better.

It’s a privilege because through Brown you all control the future of your lives. It’s why you wade through the CS all-nighters and econ snek ridicule to get to the good stuff. Well what is the good stuff? The good stuff is answering the greatest question of our time: “why the heck have sophomores been forced onto meal plan” How did that happen? \nIf you scroll Dear Blueno posts, you might get a cocktail of answers. Some mixture of food insecurity, lack of grocery stores, malnutrition, helping U-FLi students, covering spring break meals…but the numbers tell a different story, and I’m a numbers guy. The numbers tell a very clear and distinct story that the reason why sophomores have been forced onto meal plan this year is that we’ve automated away 400 on-campus jobs in Jos, Little Jo’s, Andrews, The Ratty, The Ivy Room, and The Blue Room—all the crucial places where the Bon Appétit Management Company needed to cutback costs for lost revenue, and did cutback on. \nWe are here together at Brown University, the hub of dank memes, and what we did to the cashier jobs we will now do to the homework grader jobs, the student caller jobs, the food prep jobs, the welcome desk jobs, and on and on throughout the university. \nHow many of you have noticed your favorite food missing from the dining halls you go to? And why are those food gone? \nOne-word answer: overenrollment. \nBrown University is soaking up $3.8 billion in federal endowments every single year—how much have they thought ahead about financially supporting an extra 200 incoming freshmen through the Brown Promise? \nZero. \nLess than the amount of fucks every STEM concentrator here at this university gives to their S/NC WRIT requirement. That is the math. $3.8 billion in. 0 thought back.\nMost lenient on-campus job is being a cashier at the Campus Market. The average cashier on campus is a 19-yr old first year making between 10 and 11 dollars an hour. When she’s replaced by a vending machine, what is her next move going to be? \nWhen you go complain to ResLife about you summer housing assignment and you get that bot, what do you do? What’s your next move? If you’re like me, you go “0-0-0, representative, representative, human, human,” until you get someone on the line, right? In 2 or 3 years, the sofware’s gonna sound like this: “Hey Blueno, how’s it going? What can I do for you? :^) .” You might not even realize it’s software. It’s going to be delightful, seamless, efficient. What does that mean for the 200 students that work on-campus call reception jobs making $11 an hour? \nBeing a BUDS worker is the most common job among 29% of the student body that works on-campus, and my friends at Silicon Valley are working on robotic workers that make curry, cook pasta, cook pizza, make sandwiches, and take meal credits without swiping. They are 98% of the way there. What is that going to mean or the 60 Brunonians who work at BUDS part time right now? Or the 7000 students who are hungry for chicken nuggets, spicy withs, and mozz sticks that rely on Jos to have the food they crave after a drunk night of partying? \nWe talk about it like BUDS is the cause of all our problems. They are not. The decline of Jos is a symptom. It is a manifestation. We’re going through the greatest student body transformation in our university’s history—what experts are calling the “4th Dining Revolution”. When’s the last time you heard a politician say “4th Dining Revolution”? Just now. And I am barely a politician! \nSo the question is: “what are Brown Democrats going to do about it”? We have to make it known to our fellow students that it is not high school employees that are causing these problems, it is admissions oversight. High school BUDS workers are getting scapegoated for something they have n o t h I n g to do with. So the question is: “How do we solve this problem for the Brown student”? We have to take a new vision to our fellow students as fast as possible. \nIf you’ve ever heard anything about me and my campaign, you’ve heard something like this: “There’s an Asian man running for president who wants to give everyone $1000 flex points a month.” You remember hearing that? You remember the first time you heard that? Nothing quite like the first time am I right?? First time you heard it, it seemed like a gimmick. Seemed like there’s no way that would ever happen. But if you dig into our university’s history, you find this is a deeply Brunonian idea. \nJohn Brown was for it at the founding of our university—called it the student’s dividend. Inman Page championed it and fought for it in the 1870s, and it was what he was fighting for up to the day he graduated in 1877. \nA hundred staff members endorsed it in the 60s and 70s—it was so mainstream that it was approved in financial aid board meetings twice in 1971 as the Meal Assistance Plan. \nAnd 11 years later one state passed a dividend where new every student in that university system receives between $1000-$2000 in meal credits a year—no questions asked. And what university is that?\n*University of Alaska!!*\nAnd how do they pay fund it?\n*Oil!!!!* \nAnd what is the oil of Brown University? Memes, that’s right!! ResLife memes, Granoff dinner memes, Ratty memes, Blueno memes. A study from Cornell University just came out that said that your memes—our memes—are now worth more than oil. How many of you received your meme check in the mail room? \nNone of us.\nIn the University of Alaska school system they call it the “Oil Check,” and they love it. We’re gonna call this the “Meme Check,” and all of Brunonia’s gonna love it. And I want you to think about what $1000 in Flex Points would mean in our school lives. It would mean stronger friendships, higher graduation rates, lower stress levels, eradicated sexual assault. It would start to recognize the work that’s actually being done in our student groups. Every single day it would create hundreds of full stomachs, would supercharge the arts, creativity, volunteerism, culture, and student government engagement. This is the vision that will win in 2020. \nI get it. I’m an operator. The action happens on the ground. We have to empower our students on the ground. How many of you were excited about admission rates when you woke up this morning? How many of your were like “I’m gonna make a big contribution today, I can feel it!” If you think about it, we’re at record low admission rates and record high incoming student body sizes. Also at record highs at this university right now: student dropout rates, drug overdose, anxiety, depression, food insecurity. It’s gotten so bad that our graduation rate has declined for the last 3 years in a row. Last time our graduation rate declined 3 years in a row? The Spanish Flu of 1918. Global pandemic. That’s the last time it happened. We need to evolve to the next set of measurements. \nAnd I talk about my daughter who’s at university with her two young boys—one of whom is autistic—how much better does the Brown Promise alleviate her struggle coupled with an overadmitted incoming class size every year? Zero. And we know that’s nonsense. We know it should be the opposite of the truth. We know that her sacrifice—I was off the trail for a couple days taking care of my grandkids, and you know what I said after two days? “Get me back to running for president as soon as possible.” And if you’re a parent you know exactly what I’m talking about. It’s the hardest work there is—but the most important. \nInstead of this low admission rate/large incoming class measurement that’s running us off a cliff, we should be measuring our shared progress through health and retention rates. Mental health and freedom from substance abuse. Good food, good campus markets. Academic success benchmarks. This is the vision of a student body that would actually work for the Brown student body. \nRight now, Brown Democrats are being cast as the group that wants the option to get off meal plan. We want to move meal plans forward, and we need the right measurements to do that. So this is the vision we have to take to the rest of the university as fast as possible. We have to solve the problems that got sophomores stuck on a subpar meal plan. \nIf you remember in 2019 what did Josiah Carberry say? He said “We’re gonna Make Jos Great Again.” And then what did C. Pax respond…? “Jos is already great.” And that did not. Quite. Work. His solutions were garbage and nonsense. He said we’re gonna remove the vending machines, turn the clock back, we’re gonna bring the chicken nuggets back. We have to do the opposite of all that. We have to turn the clock forward. We have to accelerate our student body and meal plans. We have to evolve in the way we think about university dining and satisfaction. And I am the ideal candidate for that job, because the opposite of Josiah Carberry is an Asian man who likes memes.\nThank you very much Brown! Thank you very much. Let’s Make Every Meal Excellent, and win!\n- John Yang 2020 \"\n","date":"Sep 12, 2019, 9:52 AM"},{"content":"\"9766 - The way people greet me versus people greet other people are like night and day.

That's an idea we're so familiar with, whether we subscribe to it or not, that it's kind of odd to think what it actually means, because really what it means is 'Here is an idea or a notion that you're not allowed to say anything bad about; you're just not. Why not? — because you're not!' If somebody votes for a party that you don't agree with, you're free to argue about it as much as you like; everybody will have an argument but nobody feels aggrieved by it. If somebody thinks taxes should go up or down you are free to have an argument about it, but on the other hand if somebody says 'I mustn't move a light switch on a Saturday', you say, 'Fine, I respect that'... Yet when you look at it rationally there is no reason why those ideas shouldn't be as open to debate as any other, except that we have agreed somehow between us that they shouldn't be.\"\"\n\nWhy are religious ideas not as open to debate as are other ideas?\"\n","date":"Sep 12, 2019, 9:51 AM"},{"content":"9754 - anyone taken math 350 (honors multi) with abramovich? what are the exams like/what material should we study for them (lectures, textbook, etc)\n","date":"Sep 12, 2019, 9:51 AM"},{"content":"9753 - What are the best clubs for socials n PaRtYiNg!!!\n","date":"Sep 12, 2019, 9:51 AM"},{"content":"\"9752 - does anyone have any advice/resources for a first year student kinda overwhelmed and very much terrified by the idea of doing their first paper? also, on a more niche note, how is prof. scherer w/ grading, particularly for the book reaction essays?\n\nthanks, and sorry for this stupid first year question ♥\"\n","date":"Sep 12, 2019, 9:51 AM"},{"content":"9751 - is there still going to be a poster sale?\n","date":"Sep 12, 2019, 9:51 AM"},{"content":"9750 - Why is there a motorcycle gang on Thayer that vroom-vrooms every night?

Anyway, it’s gotten to the point where it’s clearly not a coincidence that so many outlets are essentially denying his existence in so many ways. Despite polling in 6th, he’s had fewer articles and stories about him than almost any candidate. For Bernie fans out there, doesn’t this remind you of 2016?

If you disagree with someone, you need to bring them to the table, and then demonstrate why they’re wrong. You can’t exclude them from the table if you want to actually fight back against them.\n","date":"Sep 7, 2019, 6:06 PM"},{"content":"9528 - Do I actually have to do the readings for CLPS 0010?
