A few days ago, I was standing in line when a guy I've had a crush on since taking a class together freshman year joined the line behind me with a friend. Cue blushing, pretending to be busy with something else so he wouldn't see. And in the minutes he stood behind me, the image I had of him as smart and put together and compassionate disintegrated as I overheard him being crude and flippant with his friend.\n\nSince then, as I've walked around campus and seen other long-time crushes, I've realized that I don't really know them. Today I saw a woman from debate that I've thought is breathtakingly beautiful for so long and realized she has a whole life that exists very well without me. I trust that there are tons of wonderful people here at Brown (there are!), but the expected last hurrah of pursing the people you haven't mustered the courage to ask out yet is no longer as appealing (and I have hooked up and dated and asked folks out and been rejected in my time at Brown).

I told her that she was the first person to ever ask me that question and she‚Äôs all like ‚Äúwow what sorts of terrible people have you dated?‚Äù At the time I was like ‚Äúyeah, every single other person has been a total piece of shit!‚Äù BUT THAT‚ÄôS NOT TRUE. Since then, I‚Äôve asked every person I‚Äôve hooked up what they liked and (like me) they‚Äôve all been super surprised by the question! Like, really honestly surprised! Which is kind of sad, you know? Lots of people haven‚Äôt had an answer right away (because, you know, we‚Äôre all still trying to figure all of this shit out) but we always make some progress and talk about it which is always awkward but kind of nice? Talking about sex is SO stigmatized and there‚Äôs all of this pressure to be good at it ALL THE TIME and I feel like it‚Äôs so easy to dismiss the fact that there‚Äôs a learning process attached to the whole thing. \n\nAsk people what they like! If they don‚Äôt know, try some stuff and check in to see what feels good! Not everyone likes the same kinky stuff and people‚Äôs interests change so check in regularly! I‚Äôm sure there are groups on campus that talk about this stuff so imma try to seek them out and it‚Äôd be cool if other people went too!

I think you have to do it in a way that isn't incredibly sexualized and that gives her space to leave. Like if you approach her and she seems uncomfortable you can ask respectfully if she wants you to leave (making it clear that you are totally okay with that) or just give her an out/leave yourself. Don't instigate a conversation based around her body, but compliments, including about her style choices are okay (hair color, dress, etc) so long as they aren't sexualized. If you can find a commonality or obvious talking point, that's best though. Not holding her up is ideal because you dont want her to feel trapped, so if things seem to be going well you can offer to give her your number. Don't ask for hers, because that can be super uncomfortable as a woman, but giving her yours gives her the autonomy and choice. Overall, treat her like a person, do not be overbearing and try to be cognizant of your privilege and her body language and you'll be okay\n","date":"Feb 23, 2019, 1:49 PM"},{"content":"6160 - rest in fucking pieces to all the poor souls who dropped their model kits during the orgo exam\n","date":"Feb 23, 2019, 1:49 PM"},{"content":"6159 - Alex M - Glad were friends, Happy Bday!\n","date":"Feb 23, 2019, 1:49 PM"},{"content":"6158 - Ian Brown I heard u a life guard... how about you guard my groin ... p.s.

Then as you take out excitedly you realize everyone around you thinks it looks like diarrhea and smells pungent, so you hide and gobble it hurriedly while your roommate's not home in the corner of your solitude. \n\nIf we wanted to, we could say the same about common white food.

Do you have someone that you‚Äôve been idly thinking for months that you‚Äôd like to get to know better? Do you have a major super-crush on a super kool kat? Have you been posting BBA posts telling someone to make a move or asking if someone would be down for a date but then never following up? Well that‚Äôs bad! Don‚Äôt do that!\n\nIncreasingly as I‚Äôve reflected on why I haven‚Äôt asked out people I‚Äôm into -- either as potential friends or ~love interests~ -- I‚Äôve come up blank. The truth is, if you ask someone out for coffee, __as long as you‚Äôre not creepy or weird about it, it‚Äôs not really that scary of an experience__. Here are some tippers!\n\nA: Personally, when you‚Äôre first getting to know someone you might be _into_, I think it‚Äôs a _lot_ better to just ask them out for coffee and have it be a bit ambiguous if it‚Äôs a date-date or just a friend-date. If you explicitly label it as a date-date when you ask someone out, there‚Äôs a strong chance it will come off weirdly if you don‚Äôt know them very well, and there‚Äôs now a lot more pressure and expectations in the mix. People don‚Äôt want to go on a second ‚Äúdate‚Äù unless the first one goes really well, and if it doesn‚Äôt go really well, people tend to feel more awkward about it.\n\nOn the flip side, it‚Äôs a lot less weird to ask someone you don‚Äôt know that well out to coffee than it is to ask them to go on a _date_ with you. And in this case, you can still end up both having a great time and ending up ~into~ one another, but even if you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre probably a bit closer now and would be willing to do it again some time as long as it doesn‚Äôt go super badly. And in the end, regardless of how they view it in their own head, good healthy relationships require you to get to know someone and be their friend, and good relationships can often take a long time to form or get started.\n\nFeel free to disregard if you‚Äôre reasonably confident that both of you are ~into~ one another.\n\nB: People like meeting new people! We all want friends! Most of us want to find love or companionship! As long as you‚Äôre not weird or creepy about it, if you ask someone out for coffee, they‚Äôll probably be pretty excited or flattered that you think they‚Äôre ~kool~ enough that you felt the desire to reach out to them! Unless you give someone a reason to not like you or feel comfortable grabbing coffee with you, you really probably don‚Äôt have much to worry about.\n\nC: Even if someone does say no, rejection isn‚Äôt really that scary. Honestly, what‚Äôs the big deal? Unless you make a big deal out of it and act weirdly around them for the rest of your life, no one really cares. Some of my current friends are people I had crushes on and told them, only for them to tell me they didn‚Äôt reciprocate. Some of my friends are people that told me they had crushes on me, only for me to tell them I didn‚Äôt feel the same way. It‚Äôs part of life. It‚Äôs not really weird unless you decide to make it weird!\n\nWith that all said, even if you know you should shoot your shot, it can be a bit hard to know what that looks like. Should you walk up to someone and ask them point blank? What exactly should you say? My personal opinion is that in most situations, hitting someone up on Messenger is usually the way to go, and you can just say something like\n\nTo someone you barely know (provide some motivation to how you know who they are):\n‚ÄúHey, I know this is kinda like out of the blue, but I‚Äôve [seen you around] (replace this with how you know of them if you know them through taking a class or something) and you seem really cool. Would you maybe be down to grab coffee sometime?‚Äù\n\nTo someone you know a little bit better:\n‚ÄúHey, I know this is kind of out of the blue, but you seem really cool and I was wondering if you maybe would be down to grab coffee sometime?‚Äù\n\nTo someone you kind of consider a friend:\n‚ÄúHey, do you want to maybe grab coffee sometime?‚Äù\n\nIf all of those are too awkward for you and you need to provide a little extra motivation, feel free to hit em with a\n‚ÄúHey, I made a New Year‚Äôs resolution to try to reach out to people I‚Äôd like to get to know a little better. Would you maybe be down to grab coffee sometime?‚Äù\nor a more general\n‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve been trying hard lately to reach out to people that I‚Äôd like to get to know a bit better. Would you maybe be down to grab coffee sometime?‚Äù\n\nIf you have any critiques of these, or have better less awk feeling/more natural ways to say any of this, post in the comments below, although these ones have worked okay for me!\n\nIn the end though, I know a lot of people who are p lonely, and pretty much everyone I know wants to know a few extra people or to get ~close~ with someone, so I‚Äômma make 2019 the year I shoot my shots, and I‚Äôm encouraging everyone else to too! (And I know this is an anonymous post, but please shoot your shots at me too!)

Without either of these, the dumpling is no longer a dumpling but rather, much like myself, a massive disappointment. Those of us who have been consoled by the hopes that it is not what's on the outside that matters will be sadly disappointed to hear that the outside is the most important dumpling determiner. However fear not! Dumplings have shown mankind that it is possible to be soft, doughy, AND beautiful. In that vein, the outside of the dumpling must be starchy and dough-based and be formed of one (or at most two joined) pieces that can be wrapped or folded around the filling (dipping the filling into a batter and frying is not a dumpling that's just fried food which is also great but again, not. a. dumpling.). The filling, which we shall address in a moment, shall be almost completely encased by the wrapping. In this field, I am somewhat of a pioneer for my allowance of a small gap or hole. However, holes can be valuable as without one on your face you could never consume the delicious delicacy that is the dumpling. Nonetheless, we must be careful to limit this gap to a certain size. For example, a pita pocket is no longer a dumpling due to the large opening required to add the stuffing. The final criteria for the encasing is that it should be, in a sense, solid and able to hold its form under some duress. As a counterexample, let us examine a burrito. Although upon initial inspection we have a dumpling-like object, the fact of the matter is that a wrapped outside that has not been set by some form of cooking, such as steaming or boiling, can be easily unwrapped. In the instance where the casing and the filling can be separated with such ease, we have an entity that is, sadly, not a dumpling. \nAt last we come to the filling of the dumpling. Some consider this a rather avant-garde approach, but I posit that the only thing that really matters is that a filling exists and is edible. These minimal criteria may, of course, lead to some very poor dumplings, but these are dumplings nonetheless. A dumpling exterior without a filling is only an empty shell of a dumpling and a social pariah of the dumpling world. But it is the happy union of an excellent filling and a dough-based exterior that forms a superior dumpling. And so we have the mighty dumpling. \n\nwow yeah i need a life\n","date":"Dec 9, 2018, 1:37 AM"},{"content":"3875 - Shout out to Ariana Barzinpour for infinite amounts of patience and altruism.

It seemed like everyone else had a solid friend group who they had so much fun with, and I started to think maybe it was because I wasn't interesting or because there were too many differences between me and other kids here. I considered transferring, too.\nBut it got better! I made one close friend, who introduced me to their friends, and through them I kept meeting new people. It's a lot easier to make new friends if you have someone to introduce you - and it's way more likely that you'll like the new people you'll meet too. \nIt's easier said than done to go, \"\"just meet that one friend, through them you'll meet lots of other people\"\", but that's how it worked for me! If you meet someone who you think has a similar sense of humor to you, has similar interests, just reach out! Don't worry about looking desperate.

Tag the wholesome guy (or guys!) in your life. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n","date":"Nov 30, 2018, 2:14 PM"},{"content":"3541 - As the semester closes out, i wanted to give a special shoutout to everyone for making it through (GO US!!! seriously incredible and no small feat) but especially to the first years. I'm a sophomore, and last year at this time I was tired, lonely, burnt out, riddled with impostor syndrome and kind of sad. I'd made a few friends here and there, but I didn't feel comfortable on this campus AT ALL. In any way shape or form. Dealing with first semester (and frankly, the entire first two years of college) can be A LOT. For some of you, it may have been your best 3 months ever! To those people, I offer my sincerest congratulations. I'm happy for you. But for the rest of you who don't feel comfortable at Brown yet, who feel lonely, or isolated, or academically strained, or like the expectations at Brown in every area of life have been too much to bear, I offer this: I am in such a better place now than I was a year ago. And it will get better for you too - please believe that. Sheer repetition on this campus makes for comfort. Finding your favorite study spot in the library. Molding a routine that works for you. Saying hi to the same people you pass in the street on the way to class. Learning all the street names and building names simply by passing them by. Will you ever feel 100% comfortable here? Maybe not. I don't, many days. But the thing that's different is that now I've learned that it's ok to feel out of place here! I felt so much pressure my first year to fit in, to look like I was having the best time of my life, to report to my nosy and caring relatives that I was abundantly happy. Now I know that it's ok to take stock of everything, good and bad, comfort and discomfort, happiness and sadness, friendship and loneliness, A's and B's and C's and NC's (lol brown) and to accept it all for what it is instead of fighting it. To acknowledge that it might cause me pain or unease, and that those feelings are valid and ok. And that everyone has them - even if they paint a picture of perfection in public. Perfection simply isn't true for any person on this campus. \n\nSo to all the first years who feel like this semester was the hardest 3 month span of your life - I can absolutely, 100% guarantee you that you are FAR from alone. Even though everyone else wants to make you feel like you're the only one struggling. You will come to realize you are not. I also want to incorporate a SPECIAL shoutout to my FLi first years - you guys have accomplished a miracle, truly, and should be bursting with pride, however this semester ends for you. I admire all of you so. damn. much. \n\nWhile I do know some of you personally (y'all are awesome), I don't know most of you.... but in both cases, I'm extremely proud of all of you for getting through your first semester in one of the most academically and socially and extracurricularly stringent environments in the country. You guys DID! THAT! And the beautiful thing about college is that every single semester is a completely blank slate, full of glorious potential for the things to come, things you can't even fathom.\n","date":"Nov 30, 2018, 2:14 PM"},{"content":"3540 - Kyle Reece for spring weekend ‚ô•\n","date":"Nov 30, 2018, 2:13 PM"},{"content":"3539 - to the people that take the time to thank the buds workers at the ratty: thank YOU for acknowledging us & being so kind! sometimes it feels like we are slept on, but y'all always make our day when you smile & thank us ‚ô•\n","date":"Nov 30, 2018, 2:13 PM"},{"content":"3538 - I don't know any of them that well but Star, Evan, and Carlyn's friendship seems like the most wholesome thing ever\n","date":"Nov 30, 2018, 2:13 PM"},{"content":"3537 - I don‚Äôt know Ahmed really well but I just saw back of the throat and holy fucking shit how why WHAT\n","date":"Nov 30, 2018, 2:13 PM"},{"content":"3536 - Philip Yang, your smile brightens up my day.

We‚Äôve never actually been introduced, but we‚Äôve been face to face on numerous occasions, and I‚Äôd like to think on most subjects we see eye to eye, even though we‚Äôre so different. I work all night and you work all day, and everyday our paths cross, but I can‚Äôt change my schedule and I know you can‚Äôt change yours, so I guess we‚Äôll just have to keep it that way. I know I am one of many, know there are countless others chasing after you, but I still can‚Äôt shake the feeling that our relationship is different; everyone likes to lump us together, our names and dominions go hand in hand, but in all honesty, we can never meet, not properly I mean. If we did, it might be like one of those things, where the universe implodes or something. Even though I‚Äôm small and cold and pale in comparison, I only shine because of you. Too bad we can‚Äôt meet up, I‚Äôll have to love you from afar, but when it comes down to it, that‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs always been.\nIt‚Äôs right that you should be the center and leave all others to orbit in your wake.\nYou‚Äôre the only chinghoo for me\n","date":"Nov 16, 2018, 7:58 PM"},{"content":"3131 - Guy with earrings and bean boots on 3rd floor CIT Friday afternoon ‚Äî coffee?\n","date":"Nov 16, 2018, 7:58 PM"},{"content":"3130 - @3034\n\nS/o to all the non-monogamous folks on campus - whether you‚Äôre partnered or not, you deserve love and respect!\n\nAs an ethically non-monogamous woman myself, I have really tried to keep my composure over your post. It‚Äôs a little humorous, this idea of being ‚Äútoo woke.‚Äù But I can tell you, for myself, my partners, and the precious few other non-mono folks I know on campus, that we don‚Äôt live this way to be ‚Äúwoke.‚Äù And I‚Äôm flat-out pissed that you would insinuate that.\n\nI agree that it is icky when a guy says that he‚Äôs ‚Äúwoke‚Äù because of the fact that he‚Äôs in a non-mono relationship or is considering one. But if someone you admire to be woke for other reasons is questioning why monogamy is the dominant relationship structure in our society, maybe listen a moment before dismissing him? Mononormativity (like the post that you made) hurts. It says that I shouldn‚Äôt love my partners, or be happy for them finding love with other people, or seek out friendship with their partners or wish for a day when we can all live together. In some states, my love is a literal crime. \n\nSeeing all those people react positively to your sentiment validates your demonization of non-mono people and honestly makes me sad.\n\nTo be clear, I have no problem with people who practice monogamy, and when dating I try to be as transparent as possible about my non-monogamous status. I also don‚Äôt think a la Sex At Dawn that everyone should be non-monogamous ‚Äî but it should be an option. Mononormative society only allows for people to be single, or monogamous, or cheat (aka, non-ethically non-monogamous). Creating space for non-monogamous options is difficult because it challenges the way we‚Äôve been taught to think about love, sex, and power. And I want that choice for everyone.\n\nWokeness doesn't have any correlation to relationship structure, and treating non-monogamous folks as \"\"too woke\"\" is distressingly dismissive. I hope you find someone to enjoy a monogamous relationship with and shares your values, but please don't treat people who structure their relationships differently from you as worse people for it.\n","date":"Nov 16, 2018, 7:57 PM"},{"content":"3129 - Lisa the 33 TA was so helpful and nice today during lab hours!

Usually just for friends or random people doing something beautiful (I guess that includes existing?)... but never like this. I'm also super nervous, not just because I'm afraid of what this person'll think, or because I don't want people to casually talk about my feelings in the comments, or just for fear of this coming off as cheesy or inconsequential or some other thing I should be afraid of. But because... well, I really like this person, and that makes me nervous. Nothing new on BBA, right? \nI guess I need to put this out there, for this person to know or at least to work through it on my own. Uhh, I haven't had this happen in all my time at Brown‚Äîwhich was a relief, believe me‚Äîbut regardless, I really like this one person. Actually the sweetest person I've met in college, possibly ever. And ridiculously smart‚Äîand not just Brown smart, like actually boutta-f*ck-up-their-industry-and-maybe-the-world smart. Really funny too, the whole thing going on.\nAnd I get that when you like someone, everything about them is beautiful, and maybe that's what's happening here, or maybe that's just who this person is. Independent of whether I like him, I'd like to think his smile is still so bright it's almost unacceptable, and the way he says \"\"sweet\"\" after something goes right is just as endearing, and gosh, he's such a dork it makes me want to cry. Also his ears turn pink when he laughs, and he just has this whole 'good-natured' feel about him, and I can't help but think that he's so soft and that I want to hold his face. He's so nice to listen to, not just because his voice sounds nice, but also because he's so nerdy in a really comfortable way, and it's oddly soothing. He also has the most interesting face, and I always end up doodling that objectively good nose and and really strong widow's peak, but of course I can't do him any justice. It doesn't help that I have the feeling he gives really good hugs, and he'd be so nice to be held by...\nThere's so much more about him, but this is already longer than I told myself I'd allow it to be. He most definitely doesn't know who this is from, probably because I'm sure there are plenty of people weak for him, and also because he makes me too shy to have made an impression on him. So yeah, that's been my incredibly cowardly confession. Take it as it is, and I'll just... I'll just leave it at that.\n\n(for Ben Insley... sorry if you had to read through all this)\n","date":"Nov 15, 2018, 4:17 PM"},{"content":"3066 - Tag a meme master\n","date":"Nov 15, 2018, 4:17 PM"},{"content":"3065 - Chaz Vest in his cream turtleneck can like... get it\n","date":"Nov 15, 2018, 4:17 PM"},{"content":"3064 - Thank you to all the ERC cafe baristas for keeping me alive with quality caffeine and doing it with amazing fashion and a smile ‚ù§Ô∏è\n","date":"Nov 15, 2018, 4:16 PM"},{"content":"3063 - Valerie the UI/UX TA is awesome!

There are some venting posts, confessions, campus/resource questions, etc. We've been trying to keep this page a feel-good space with mostly just admiration posts. That's what we want, but is this the right way to go? What do you want?\n\nDo you want us to allow more non-admiration posts, or stay the same? We'd love to hear your thoughts, so please vote and leave a comment if you have a minute. If you want, we're open to start publishing more non-admiring posts, like non-offensive confessions, on a trial basis for about a week. \n\nWe really want to make sure that we're doing the best we can be the best we can. Love, BBA ‚ù§\n","date":"Nov 8, 2018, 9:31 PM"},{"content":"2625 - tall blonde girl wearing heels and a small pink purse, isabel guerneri i think? you're stunning, single??\n","date":"Nov 8, 2018, 9:28 PM"},{"content":"2624 - Tathy Amaral will always light up my day\n","date":"Nov 8, 2018, 9:28 PM"},{"content":"2623 - I saw someone look up Angela Zhuo on Facebook during lecture and then proceed to investigate her LinkedIn lmao\n","date":"Nov 8, 2018, 9:27 PM"},{"content":"2622 - concerned and nervous sophomore here! has anyone taken BIOL1120: Biomaterials, is it hard???\n","date":"Nov 8, 2018, 9:27 PM"},{"content":"2621 - To the girl at Haruki thurs night eating ikura sushi and sitting with your back to the door: you are so cute!

It wasn't something groundbreaking, but it made a huge difference for me - I got off campus. When I woke up today and looked out my window I could see how beautiful it was outside, but when I got out of bed and headed to class the beauty of the day was lost to me. I tried desperately to find it because I knew if I did it would make me happy, but it was nowhere to be found. After my class ended, I sought it elsewhere. I walked off campus, down the hill a bit to Prospect Park, and there it was. The cool air, the scattered leaves, the clear sky, all combined and it was as if a fog cleared from my eyes. I felt really happy for the first time in a long time. After a while I had to return to campus for more classes, and though nothing about the weather or the day changed, I could no longer see what I saw off-campus earlier. For some reason, the campus itself was muting it for me, and that was kind of revelatory. Yet for the rest of the day I carried that happiness in me and friends even noted the change. \nI find it really easy while on the hill to think that the world ends at the foot of the hill. The surrounding city and towns blur away, and the hill and its inhabitants feel like all there is. I think today made more clear to me that I have to challenge that regularly and make myself push that boundary, because beyond it is where I can be reminded about the rest of the world and the beauty and happiness in it. I think I will start trying to schedule off-hill time to help achieve that, whether that means going back to Prospect or India Point Park, walking/riding along the East Bay Bike Path, or even just sitting and doing work at the mall where I can be surrounded by people who look more like the rest of the world and less like the microcosm that is Brown. I think that will be very helpful for me, and I hope that it can be helpful for some of you as well. Don't give up, you deserve happiness and it is out there, even if you can't find it within the confines of this campus. And if anyone needs a friend to get off-campus with let me know, or just find me off the hill :)\n","date":"Nov 8, 2018, 9:23 PM"},{"content":"2590 - Neil (last name Sehgal??), your varsity tennis abilities are incredible!!! ‚ô• Hang out sometime? ;)\n","date":"Nov 8, 2018, 9:23 PM"},{"content":"2589 - How does one get into bed with Young Zheng?\n","date":"Nov 8, 2018, 9:23 PM"},{"content":"2588 - Jo's, I love you, but please stop changing the quesadilla station ingredients.

It kind of pains me to say this, because as much as it might be comforting to hear, it‚Äôs also a pretty bleak statement about the culture here, but, you aren‚Äôt alone.\n\nI‚Äôm writing this post in hopes that in putting some of the negative things I feel about Brown into words, I might reach some sort of catharsis, and I‚Äôm hoping if you‚Äôre not doing so well right now or if any of this resonates with you in some way, this might be a bit cathartic for you too.\n\nI‚Äôve been here for about three years now, and naively, I keep expecting each new semester to be the one where I suddenly become happy, where I find friends that make me excited to wake up every day, or where I finally, if not start to love my life, at least find a bit of peace and contentment. I keep being wrong. \n\nFor a while, I wondered if this was due to some personal failing of mine. Maybe I just didn‚Äôt fit in here. Maybe I was just too flawed to exist in a space like Brown or to warrant happiness here. And in full honesty, there might be a shred of truth in that: I‚Äôm not a perfect person. I have a lot of things that I can work on and a lot of room to be a better. Because of that, I worried that my unhappiness had just become a fact of life. That it was independent from Brown. That, barring some major self-transformation, I‚Äôd remain equally dissatisfied for the foreseeable future. \n\nAt the height of this all, my health went to shit. My energy plummeted. I began to wonder if I had depression. And more than anything, I just needed a break.\n\nSo I took one.\n\nI left Brown for a while, and, while it didn‚Äôt happen instantly, I felt better. I made a ton of friends I genuinely enjoyed being with. Most days, I woke up pretty excited. I grew a lot. I learned a lot. I felt healthy. And when it finally came time to come back to Brown, I was a bit anxious, but more so than ever I was hopeful. After being happy for so long, I could hardly imagine that it wouldn‚Äôt carry through to school. I was ready to be happy here at Brown.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nWhat I ended up realizing is that Brown just isn‚Äôt really a place for me. \n\nTo some extent, I‚Äôm happy that I ended up here, because I really have been getting a great education, and I think it‚Äôs going to do me well after college is over. In truth, though, if I had a do-over, it‚Äôs not that I would come to Brown and just do things differently, I just wouldn‚Äôt have come to Brown in the first place.\n\nSome cynical part of me wants to say that it‚Äôs the people here. Because I‚Äôve met so many bitter people here at Brown. People who are constantly trying to prove something, people who need to feel like they‚Äôre superior to you, people who never learned healthy social habits and who think they‚Äôre too smart to be at fault or need to change. Most of all, people who are also unhappy, but have been taught that their own self-care is more important than being a decent human being and people who encourage them to continue believing that.\n\nAnd, honestly, I feel like there‚Äôs more than a shred of truth in all of that. And that there‚Äôs dozens of other issues with how people at this school act that I could rant about for days. But I don‚Äôt think that so many people here would act in these sorts of ways if there weren‚Äôt a deeper problem with the culture here in general. So, most of all,\n\nI don‚Äôt like Brown because it‚Äôs not valid to be unhappy here. \n\nI think maybe it‚Äôs because Brown has the reputation of being such a happy place. It‚Äôs because when you take the tour here, everyone is smiling, and people will shout at you that you should come here, and you‚Äôll love it. But the end result is that when we feel unhappy here we tend to think there‚Äôs something wrong with us or that we don‚Äôt belong here. And when we‚Äôre sad and feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with us, it‚Äôs pretty easy to be bitter. It‚Äôs pretty easy to try to latch onto anything that makes it seem like people like us more.\n\nBut even more so, I don‚Äôt like Brown because it‚Äôs so easy to be lonely here.\n\nMaybe that‚Äôs why so many of us are sad in the first place. Despite being surrounded by people all the time, despite having periods of my college life where I‚Äôve had a lot of friends, I never really found people I actually felt comfortable opening up to or that I was able to really get close with. I‚Äôm not completely sure why. Maybe it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre all putting on acts and don‚Äôt like the acts that everyone else is putting on. I don‚Äôt know.\n\nWhat I do know is that I‚Äôm not unique in any of this. The number of people who‚Äôve eventually revealed to me that they‚Äôre unhappy here has been staggering. The number of people who‚Äôve told me they suffer from serious anxiety and depression which got worse when they came here, the people who‚Äôve told me they engage in self-harm, the people who‚Äôve told me they felt suicidal or have attempted suicide while here. It occasionally leaves me wondering if Brown is really the place for anyone.\n\nI hope it is. I hope that there are a bunch of people out there who are happy here and have managed to be happy without hurting other people or making them unhappy instead. I tend to believe this less and less the more people I get to know.\n\nIn any case, though, know that if you‚Äôre not doing so well at Brown, you‚Äôre not alone. You‚Äôre not an anomaly or a freak. Being sad here doesn‚Äôt mean that there‚Äôs something wrong with you or that you don‚Äôt belong here. I‚Äôm not telling you that it will pass or that if you‚Äôre sad here, it will eventually go away, but despite the fact it often doesn‚Äôt feel like it, this is the beginning of our lives, not the end or the peak. If you‚Äôre thinking about taking some time off, going abroad, or even transferring, that‚Äôs more than valid. If you need to take one fewer class or take something S/NC because you‚Äôre extra low on energy this semester, that‚Äôs valid too.\n\nFor me, I‚Äôm going to keep on hoping and doing my best to make each semester be the one that finally makes me happy here. I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs going to happen, but hey, I don‚Äôt have too many more to go. But really, more than anything, I just hope you all find a bit more happiness here than I did.\n","date":"Oct 29, 2018, 12:57 PM"},{"content":"1995 - Shoutout to all the closeted athletes\n","date":"Oct 29, 2018, 12:56 PM"},{"content":"1994 - Tbh, I feel incredibly annoyed at myself; I've been depressed and anxious for weeks, but as soon as I cleared out the stress, immediately self destructive urges and shit flooded in, and I'm just so annoyed at my brain üòÇ I admire anyone who's got a problem like this and is still a functional human\n","date":"Oct 29, 2018, 12:56 PM"},{"content":"1993 - ummm talk to me in class dammit\n","date":"Oct 29, 2018, 12:56 PM"},{"content":"1992 - to the person blasting Beast of Burden at 2am - thank you for the quality jam\n","date":"Oct 29, 2018, 12:56 PM"},{"content":"1991 - To the boy that was playing the guitar and singing on the 4th floor of new dorm A today, you were amazing!! please play more often ‚ô• \nI also loved the song choices, btw\n","date":"Oct 29, 2018, 12:56 PM"},{"content":"1990 - to the guy at the halloweekend party with whom i joked could have been an abercrombie model -- coffee? if u swing that way ;)\n","date":"Oct 29, 2018, 12:56 PM"},{"content":"1989 - can we have kero kero bonito for spring weekend?\n","date":"Oct 29, 2018, 12:56 PM"},{"content":"1988 - Girl with head, shoulders, knees, and toes üòçüòçüòç\n","date":"Oct 29, 2018, 12:56 PM"},{"content":"1987 - Who is the fraternity in Sears dorm next to the Ratty?

Sounds like you're having a tough time. That sucks. I've been there, so I kinda know what you're talking about. I've been in the ever circling vortex of self doubt, frustration, and loathing. It's no bueno. I know. If you don't mind lemme tell you a couple things. You can read em if you want, read em again later if you feel like it. But honestly man, if I spend all this time typing this out to you and you don't let it be a little tinder for your fire, well, you're just letting us both down. And you don't HAVE to do that. You don't HAVE to do anything. But you get to choose.\n\n(Who am I? My name‚Äôs Alex and I‚Äôm a freshman. Just moved to a new city for a dream job that I got because of the rules below. I owe a lot of my success to people much cooler, kinder, more loving and greater than me. When I get the chance to maybe let a little bit of help out, it‚Äôs a way of thanking them. )\n\nRule numero uno - There are no more zero days. What's a zero day? A zero day is when you don't do a single fucking thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on. No more zeros. I'm not saying you gotta bust an essay out everyday, that's not the point. The point I'm trying to make is that you have to make yourself, promise yourself, that the new SYSTEM you live in is a NON-ZERO system. Didnt' do anything all fucking day and it's 11:58 PM? Write one sentence. One pushup. Read one page of that chapter. One. Because one is non zero. You feel me? When you're in the super vortex of being bummed your pattern of behaviour is keeping the vortex goin, that's what you're used to. Turning into productivity ultimate master of the universe doesn't happen from the vortex. It happens from a massive string of CONSISTENT NON ZEROS. That's rule number one. Do not forget.\n\nLa deuxieme regle - yeah i learnt french. its a canadian thing. please excuse the lack of accent graves, but lemme get into rule number 2. BE GRATEFUL TO THE 3 YOU'S. Uh what? 3 me's? That sounds like mumbo jumbo bullshit. News flash, there are three you's homeslice. There's the past you, the present you, and the future you. If you wanna love someone and have someone love you back, you gotta learn to love yourself, and the 3 you's are the key. Be GRATEFUL to the past you for the positive things you've done. And do favours for the future you like you would for your best bro. Feeling like shit today? Stop a second, think of a good decision you made yesterday. Salad and tuna instead of Big Mac? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Was yesterday a nonzero day because you wrote 200 words (hey, that's all you could muster)? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Saved up some coin over time to buy that sweet thing you wanted? THANK YOU. Second part of the 3 me's is you gotta do your future self a favour, just like you would for your best fucking friend (no best friend? you do now. You got 2. It's future and past you). Tired as hell and can't get off reddit/videogames/interwebs? fuck you present self, this one's for future me, i'm gonna rock out p90x Ab Ripper X for 17 minutes. I'm doing this one for future me. Alarm clock goes off and bed is too comfy? Screw you present self, this one's for my best friend, the future me. I'm up and going for a 5 km run (or 25 meter run, it's gotta be non zero). MAKE SURE YOU THANK YOUR OLD SELF for rocking out at the end of every.single.thing. that makes your life better. The cycle of doing something for someone else (future you) and thanking someone for the good in your life (past you) is key to building gratitude and productivity. Do not doubt me. Over time you should spread the gratitude to others who help you on your path.\n\nRule number 3- don't worry i'm gonna too long didnt' read this bad boy at the bottom (get a pencil and piece of paper to write it down. seriously. you physically need to scratch marks on paper) FORGIVE YOURSELF. I mean it. Maybe you got all the know-how, money, ability, strength and talent to do whatever is you wanna do. But lets say you still didn't do it. Now you're giving yourself shit for not doing what you need to, to be who you want to. Heads up champion, being dissapointed in yourself causes you to be less productive. Tried your best to have a nonzero day yesterday and it failed? so what. I forgive you previous self. I forgive you. But today? Today is a nonzero masterpiece to the best of my ability for future self. This one's for you future homes. Forgiveness man, use it. I forgive you. Say it out loud.\n\nLast rule. Rule number 4, is the easiest and its three words. exercise and books. that's it. Pretty standard advice but when you exercise daily you actually get smarter. when you exercise you get high from endorphins (thanks body). when you exercise you clear your mind. when you exercise you are doing your future self a huge favour. Exercise is a leg on a three legged stool. Feel me? As for books, almost every fucking thing we've all ever thought of, or felt, or gone through, or wanted, or wanted to know how to do, or whatever, has been figured out by someone else. Get some books max. Post to about BBA about struggling with friends? Good first step! (nonzero day, thanks younger me for typing it out) You know what else you could do? Read 7 habits of highly successful people. Read \"\"emotional intelligence\"\". Read \"\"From good to great\"\". Read ‚Äúthinking fast and slow‚Äù. Read books that will help you understand. Read the bodyweight fitness reddit and incorporate it into your workouts. (how's them pullups coming?) Reading is the dang warp whistle from Super Mario 3. It gets you to the next level that much faster.\n\nThat‚Äôs about it man. There‚Äôs so much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days, but that‚Äôs not your mission right now. Your mission is nonzero and forgiveness and favours. You got 36 essays due in 24 minutes and its impossible to pull off? Your past self let you down big time, but hey‚Ä¶ I forgive you. Do as much as you can in those 24 minutes and then move on.\n\nI hope I helped a little bit max. I could write about this forever, but I promised myself I would go do a 15 minute run while listening to A. Skillz Beats Working Vol. 3. Gotta jet. One last piece of advice though. Regardless of whether or not reading this for the first time helps make your day better, if you wake up tomorrow, and you can‚Äôt remember the 4 rules I just laid out, please, please. Read this again.\n\nHave an awesome day ‚ò∫\n\ntldr; 1. Nonzero days as much as you can. 2. The three you‚Äôs, gratitude and favours. 3. Forgiveness 4. Exercise and books (which is a sneaky way of saying self improvement, both physical, emotional.\n","date":"Oct 26, 2018, 2:17 PM"},{"content":"1799 - just looking for a friend that enjoys late/high romantic classical music and that'll come to concerts with me :))\n","date":"Oct 26, 2018, 2:15 PM"},{"content":"1798 - Blonde girl tonight (10/26) at the ratty with the foot walker was gorgeous\n","date":"Oct 26, 2018, 2:14 PM"},{"content":"1797 - cute girl i constantly see in the rock -- say hi next time :)\n","date":"Oct 26, 2018, 2:14 PM"},{"content":"1796 - whoever wrote ‚ÄúReport: Glue Made From Horses, By Horses, For Horses‚Äù in the Brown Noser, please date me\n","date":"Oct 26, 2018, 9:45 AM"},{"content":"1795 - I have a crush on a person that I don't quite know, I have seen them around and have heard about them and really think we would get along.

No one's. \n\nWhat I've come to find in my time at Brown (and it's taken A LOT of time and energy and sadness to find this) is that if someone isn't struggling socially, they might be struggling academically. And if they're not struggling academically, they're probably struggling with extracurriculars. And if that's not a struggle for them, then job and internship-hunting is. And if they seem to be perfect at that, I can guarantee you that they're having an issue with their concentration or their friend group or their family or their finances.....the list goes on. And very very few people will cop to any of these issues, especially publicly. Which makes us all feel like we're behind in a race that doesn't even exist! \n\nThe point I'm trying to impart (especially to our younger students on campus) is that the person whose life you see on Instagram, who you envy, who seems to have endless supplies of whatever it is you're looking for (whether that's friends or parties or money or good grades or job offers or success in extracurricular endeavors) - I absolutely, unequivocally guarantee you that their life is much harder than it appears to be. So please don't waste your energy comparing yourself! I wish I could go back to my freshman or sophomore self and capture back alllllll of the energy and time I spent worrying about how my life stacked up to everyone else's, because as I spoke to the people I envied so much, I always came to discover that they were either struggling in a very silent way or even envied some portion of my life! \n\nLet's all be a little easier on ourselves, please!\n","date":"Oct 21, 2018, 8:25 PM"},{"content":"1541 - tall asian üòçüòç\n","date":"Oct 21, 2018, 8:25 PM"},{"content":"1540 - Augie Ge when can I see you again?\n","date":"Oct 21, 2018, 8:23 PM"},{"content":"1539 - where can a girl get yakult on this campus??? i have a craving\n","date":"Oct 21, 2018, 8:23 PM"},{"content":"1538 - Tag the most beautiful person/people/untitled lamp/bear statue that you know!\n","date":"Oct 21, 2018, 8:23 PM"},{"content":"1537 - To the group of girls off to the side stage right at ANOCH last night, y‚Äôall KILLED dancing queen and you‚Äôre all so beautiful.\n","date":"Oct 21, 2018, 8:23 PM"},{"content":"1536 - can we talk about kira johnson for a sec?

As a result my mental health and grades have gone down, but I cannot drop this course for other reasons. I have tried asking the TAs what to do and I was either told that everyone struggles (all the more reason to do something about this class) or to talk the the HTAs. I emailed the HTAs asking for help and explaining that I - and anyone with other commitments - can't reasonably do all of this with the very limited resources they give us and only 24 hrs in a day. I even made suggestions of small steps that would help. So far they have yet to respond to me. \nI know I am not the only one who is being actively harmed by and is not ok with this class.

I knew going into it that it was just a hook up, and I knew when we decided to see each other again, that we would just do that because we enjoyed the sex. And yet, my heart feels empty and somewhat heavy- almost as though something is horribly wrong. Usually I am sad when I like people who don‚Äôt like me back, and I can put my finger on in the exact moment, the exact instant and the precise cause for my sadness. But something about this situation makes it different. It‚Äôs not that I feel attached to him, nor do I regret that night. I also do want to keep hooking up with him and other people. Yet why does it feel that isn‚Äôt how it was supposed to go down? Why can I not accept that all those little gestures and moments that only happen in sweeping tales of romance, are nothing more than an empty physical, with no heart? I mean i understand that heteronormativity is a social construct, and marriage and monogamy are all constructed, so why can my heart and head not reconcile?

You might not recognize it yourself, but other people absolutely do. I hope you have the faith to believe that you will make a difference.

I may not agree with your political choices, but I sincerely appreciate that you‚Äôre not afraid to share them. \n\nTo everyone else reading this: emotions are absolutely a valid response to recent events, but that is likely not going to change anyone‚Äôs mind.

Don't top water your orchid. Phalaenopsis orchids grow upside down in situ, meaning water runs out of the main crown of the plant and water build-up can rot and kill the orchid. Pour water into the media and over the roots. Allow water to completely drain from the pot and don't leave the orchid sitting in standing water. \n2. Ditch the moss, and invest in some epiphytic orchid media. Anything that is nutrient-poor, loose and airy works (just google orchid bark). Don't use potting soil. Phal roots grow exposed to the air and need constant air flow to not suffocate, so moss is a generally terrible idea.\n3. Don't expose the poor thing to full sun. Seriously, don't give your plant sunburns. We haven't invented lather-on plant sunscreen yet.\n4. Green roots = happy and moist, Silvery-gray roots = dry and sad. Orchids don't like being dry and sad\n5. Polish the leaves. They get caked in dust so keep them nice and shiny.\n6. Don't chop off the weird, noodly things that grow from the sides of the plant. Those are its aerial roots and are very important to the plant. It's like cutting a guy's dick off. Don't do it. \nAbuse your baby, and your soul will be forever tainted with the stench of death.\n\n-signed, a person with a 10+yrs of carnivorous plant and orchid growing experience\n","date":"Oct 3, 2018, 6:45 PM"},{"content":"616 - At Brown, I always feel like the Basque language.

People claim that Brown is a place where you can try new stuff but tbh Brown has limited so many of my hobbies because I was not amazing at them. I have been rejected from so many clubs that I truly wanted to participate in and learn more about merely because I was not freaking AWESOME at them. My advise? If those !@#$%^& do not believe in you, YOU believe in yourself. Do not quit, do not give up. Find a group of people and do it independently.

People who always complain about the 'Financial Struggle‚Ñ¢ ' whenever it comes up in conversation with friends who are actually struggling. People who say they really need to work extra shifts this semester but won't bat an eyelash spending more than two hundred dollars for a single night stay in a hotel room \"\"because it was too much of a hassle to wait in the airport for the 2AM flight\"\". People who don't have to calculate every time they look at a menu because they're not thinking about how much is in their bank account or how they have to pay off their credit card. The list goes on.\nLike I was trying to comment on people at Brown who are actually okay money-wise, like they know it, AND act like or sometimes outright lie that they're also struggling financially. I'm not sure if it's their twisted way of being sympathetic or whatever, but my actual struggles are not an opportunity for people like that to throw themselves a fake pity party. Like it's not a bad thing for people to have nice things, regardless of where they are with money, but lying about how textbooks are so expensive when you bought a new pair of Coach shoes to add to a literal collection is not okay. Money issues are real things people go through, literally every waking moment, and anyone who fakes it for some sick satisfaction in playing a victim is not only disrespectful but probably has their own stuff to work through.\nSorry my original post was lacking in nuance or whatever‚ÄîI'm just sick of these fake ass hoes\n","date":"Sep 24, 2018, 1:52 PM"},{"content":"318 - Hi, are any muscule-y men looking for a girlfriend?

And not the most beautiful, most popular girl in a given community, but rather the charming one who listens to his problems and laughs at his jokes, someone assertive and funny and opinionated and someone who will make the first move. I love watching romantic movies, but I want a story that I can relate to. There seem to be many movies that show a wide range of feelings and emotions in females, but I want to see one that also shows these feelings and emotions in males; we have feelings too!\n\nPerhaps an idea for the filmwriters on campus?\n","date":"Sep 9, 2018, 10:58 PM"},{"content":"42 - if there's a brown bears admirers replacement, can it at least this time be a private group instead?\n","date":"Sep 9, 2018, 10:17 PM"},{"content":"41 - senior scramble? more like sophomore soft boiled egg\n","date":"Sep 9, 2018, 9:37 PM"},{"content":"40 - üÖ±Ô∏èone üÖ±Ô∏èoy has the skeleton key to my heart\n","date":"Sep 9, 2018, 9:35 PM"},{"content":"39 - BBA admins might be asleep but Daddy Metz keeps me up all night\n","date":"Sep 9, 2018, 9:35 PM"},{"content":"38 - Guy who works at the Andrews burrito station on Sundays, your arm tattoo is amazing\n","date":"Sep 9, 2018, 9:35 PM"},{"content":"37 - Is Brown Grindr even lit?\n","date":"Sep 9, 2018, 9:34 PM"},{"content":"36 - You're not really Blueno the Bear.
