Thank you for making our intro CS class at Brown an enjoyable and overall encouraging experience. You are such a wholesome human being and a great lecturer, but more than that, we really appreciate you as a mentor. From the beginning of placement, you tried to make us more independent and aware of the fact that we now have our own responsibilities and must be cognizant of our actions, both as students and as future contributors to society. Now, at the tail end of the class, we are walking away with more than an understanding of how to program; we understand why the skills we picked up matter, and more importantly, how to ethically be using those skills in the context of today‚Äôs world. We are absolutely floored with the amount of effort you put into transitioning this course into an online format, being super open to feedback, and still covering a wide breadth of topics. If we were given the opportunity, nearly all of us would take 19 again in a heartbeat; your enthusiasm is that infectious. Now for some easter eggs: \n\nDo you know how to write in Pitman shorthand? \n\nWhat‚Äôs the difference between (-: and <-; ? Are there any other emojis that you save for 173?

Then I had my heart broken, many times, and I began to think that the only kind of love worth anything, would be the one that would come along when I was older- the boring, sustainable kind, the kind you find when you‚Äôre thirty and looking to settle down. \nYou trudged in, slow and steady, breaking down walls, fighting all my attempts to push you away. I was terrified at how easy it was, terrified that this wasn‚Äôt the passion I secretly craved, terrified that I would find the sustainable ten years earlier than I planned. But you walked in through the door, grabbed me in your arms, and took my breath away. Like you have every day ever since. With you I find sustainability in passion, contentment in monotony, and a completeness I never imagined was possible at this very confused stage of my 21 year old life. \nI don‚Äôt know what will happen to us and where life will take us. I know that if I could choose my life right now, I would pick growing old by your side in a heartbeat over every crowning academic and professional glory I could choose to have. But, that‚Äôs irrelevant. Regardless of the future, I am so supremely grateful to you for showing me how happiness should feel, how being valued, and respected, and loved can go hand in hand with passion, (how sometimes that can mean binge watching New Girl instead of having sex) and how taking that leap of faith for love is always worth it. If not for now, if not for this, for what now and this will mean for the future. \nWord of advice from a reasonably well-experienced senior: Take the leap, kids.

After what was probably my fourth or fifth week at competitive bridge, I had a partner who Screamed at me that I was a fucking idiot and Would never be good at the game in front of everyone at the bridge club. He then sent me an email saying , ‚Äúread a book on bidding, and stop your thinking that you know how to bid. That display today was pitiful. Nobody I know plays this way. If your Play doesn‚Äôt get to some resemblance of order, you will lose future partners. Today was a complete waste of time. This man was screaming at a 17-year-old kid who literally thought this mentor was the best bridge player ever. My great grandmother played back in the day and I felt like I was dishonoring her by being so bad at the game. Flash forward to now, and I am the best player at my school, consistently place very high in tournaments with world-class players, and am more in love with the game than I ever have been.

If classes are cancelled, this will be our final round of senior scramble. If they are not cancelled, then we'll still have the additional round right before senior week.\n\nThere is one TWIST with this round: we've gotten countless requests to have a round of senior scramble that allows seniors to match with students who are not seniors, and other requests for underclassmen to be included in the pool for the matching process. Thus, we've decided to call Round 3 of Senior Scramble the \"\"Undergrad Omelette\"\", where all undergrad students can participate.\n\nRules:\n- All undergrad Brown students can participate, and can put down the name of a Brown student in any class year\n- Up to 5 names can be submitted by Saturday, March 14 at 11:59pm\n- Matches will be privately emailed to both parties on Sunday, March 15\n- A match DOES NOT imply any degree of sexual consent. Be respectful of your matches and seek consent just as you would in any other relationship.\n- Any questions should be emailed to brownscramble2020@gmail.com\n\nFill out the form at https://tinyurl.com/brownscramble2020-3\n\nReady, set, scramble!\nUpdated Mar 13, 2020, 8:07 AM\n","date":"Mar 13, 2020, 8:07 AM"},{"content":"15111 - That BEAUTIFUL boy who came into Abnormal Psych and sent us the survey?

I want to be fixed. I can't find the source. Nothing happened. Or Brown happened. My entire life happened? I've been hating every moment since moving to the states as a child. Brown happened because I can't make myself trust or like a single \"friend\" I made here, though I pretend my best to make them feel they're my favorite people ever. I feel vulnerable here, like a chick on the ground after falling from its nest that can be crushed under an unknowing heel at any moment. I don't know how people survive in this environment. I've been away from family enough to get used to home not being home, but the more the years that accumulate in me without home I feel myself breaking. Maybe I just want the attention, just for one person to notice I'm not the bubbly, hyper, happy-go-lucky girl I portray everyday. I don't want to die. I just want this kind of life to end. And a life without Brown is a broken pause button, no better than death. I say I wanna be fixed but do I There are no wants inmy life. There are only needs.

Also know that so often, these thoughts go unspoken, silenced by fear of embarrassment, fear of causing discomfort, by the moment passing, by the fact that we've all trained ourselves to let these admirations pass by. Know that just because the appreciation people feel for you is silent, does not mean that it is nonexistent.\n\nFor all you who are reading, I challenge you: let's be each other's admirers. Embrace the pleasant discomfort. Don't let all the random, mundane appreciations you feel slip away unvoiced, but share one here and there. Let's normalize a culture where showing appreciation and admiration doesn't have to be confined to an anonymous page or limited to occasions of remarkable achievement or generosity, but can be shared day-to-day, face-to-face, accompanied by a perhaps unfamiliar, but no less warm smile.\n","date":"Jan 26, 2020, 3:48 PM"},{"content":"13966 - To whoever left the rose on my desk tonight... \n\nRoses are red \nChocolate is brown \nReveal yourself\nLet‚Äôs hit the town\n","date":"Jan 26, 2020, 3:48 PM"},{"content":"13965 - Hannah Ann can do no wrong.

Our mission is to foster community, confidence, and joy among refugee youth through creative, inquiry-based learning and leadership development. Our community is built on asset-based, joyful learning; community participation and family engagement; youth leadership; and a deep commitment to creating a space for students can celebrate their identities and build friendships across common experiences of migration, resettlement, and adjustment to a new environment. \n\nThis summer, Camp RYSE is looking to continue supporting and enrolling over 100 refugee Providence youth, while hosting our program in an accessible and air-conditioned space and expanding compensated leadership opportunities for our youth. We fundraise 100% of our budget, and would very much appreciate support (through advertising, donations, etc.) in order for Camp RYSE to be safe and successful for campers.\n\nThis community is built on doing what we can, when we can. We are forever grateful for the many ways each of you contribute. You can click here to share or donate -- you can also click here to view information about our ongoing snack drive. Thank you so much for your support.\n-CAMP RYSE family\n\nhttps://fundly.com/camp-ryse?fbclid=IwAR3IYFTmfUcjPxUc6PzVfWKw1BdPSnjfX_f5096bwSiFIg4e_-TEP71E_Ns\n","date":"Apr 30, 2019, 11:25 AM"},{"content":"9578 - To the person who‚Äôs room I just accidentally walked in to in Wayland 2nd floor.
