Yes, studying is important, but that shouldn’t be your entire personality and won’t ultimately help you in life. You will get so much further as someone getting low A’s and B’s who is an interesting person with real talents, skills, and hobbies than someone who never made less than a 97 but doesn’t have a life outside of school. This is especially true if you’re planning on continuing on to med or law school, where schools like to see real human beings and not robots. Plus, you’ll actually make fun memories and good friends by doing things outside of school.

To be honest, I spent a lot of time worrying if I'd chosen the right school, and I genuinely considered transferring so I could \"\"find more people like me.\"\"\n\nBut as I settled in after first semester and met people who I love wholeheartedly, I've felt more at home. I'm still one of the most \"\"academically-focused\"\" people in my friend group. But I enjoy it.

Why should they have a right to \"\"enjoy themselves,\"\" when numerous studies have shown that their happiness actually doesn't increase significantly past an income of around 70k/year? Why should they have a right to be slightly happier than the middle class and use up twice the resources while others are trapped in poverty, debt, prison, without access to healthy food, clean water, medicine, bathrooms, stable living conditions? Even if the \"\"lazy poor\"\" narrative that conservative capitalists push were true, even if every poor person in America were poor solely because they chose not to work hard enough, should someone's laziness mean forfeiture of their right not just to a decent existence, but to survival? \n\nCapitalism wants you to believe that there is a moral base to the prioritization of the individual over the collective, but there isn't. Capitalism isn't founded on a moral ideal, but rather a desire for freedom and aspiration over safety. Capitalism is a fundamentally privileged ideology. It depends on your belief that there is something absolute and good about individualism. It rests on your complacency in your privilege. It doesn't give a shit about poor people, disabled people, or any other oppressed group. If you are happy under capitalism, you are probably privileged and/or lucky. If you are happy under capitalism, you probably don't have much of an interest in systemic change.\n\nYou can believe what you want ideologically, but don't try to tell me that your ideology is and/or has an absolute moral basis. It doesn't. Don't make fun of anti-capitalists for being mad. The people who care, the people who have something to lose, are always easy targets. Their anger is always laughable to the people with no stake in the game. If you haven't prospered under capitalism and you still support it, ask yourself why. There is no reason for excessive wealth. There never has been. The idea that anyone has a right to it is a capitalist myth. I know this rant may come off as dramatic or preach-y, but I'm so tired of people arguing on behalf of excessive wealth baselessly. Of course it's easy to argue for capitalism when you live in a capitalist country and it's all you or the majority of your audience has ever known. \"\n","date":"Aug 31, 2019, 3:06 PM"},{"content":"\"9163 - This classic conservative \"\"lol libtards mad/triggered\"\" humor is overwhelmingly immature and tiresome.

That being said, I think it's important not to characterize all criticisms of religion as disrespectful or immature or arrogant. You can respect someone's right to their faith while disagreeing, even vocally disagreeing with their beliefs. And I don't think that's just limited to whatever particular doctrines or laws their religion is associated with; you are allowed to critique other people's belief in a divine being or being(s) (and obviously, this is complicated because I think often, atheists make generalizations about what religion/divinity means that don't really cover all faiths/belief systems). Certainly faith can be beautiful and powerful and enable amazing scientific/artistic/humanitarian advances. But, (and I made this argument poorly in a previous post but I should have been clearer and more tactful about it), I do think that the concept of worship in and of itself, although not common to all belief systems, can be very dangerous. A belief in a higher power can very easily create mob mentalities, and make it easy for people to justify immoral actions based on outdated concepts of morality. \n\nI am not saying we should fight faiths, or that traditions are stupid, or that I think less of people who identify as religious. I also want to make it very clear that I'm not talking specifically about Islam, (particularly because I know much less about Islam's theological teachings than I do its cultural history); honestly, much of my thinking on this subject is rooted in my experiences with American Christianity more than any other faith. Essentially, I think that worship, though it may mean very different things to different belief systems, can do more harm than good when it is sheltered from any criticism or updating, particularly when it is attached to texts which are treated as fixed and absolute (amending these texts, which many religions have already done, would solve a lot of problems I think, but I also know that there are a lot of complications surrounding that).\n","date":"Aug 31, 2019, 3:06 PM"},{"content":"9160 - I recently posted asking for advice on roller skating in PVD (#9089), but all of the 15 comments were people tagging their friends.

There were moments of stumbling and of confusion, especially when it came to talking about her identity in a sensitive (I guess you could say PC?) way, but when you consider our parents’ backgrounds (particularly in regards to religion) they overall have handled it well. And now they’re super supportive and are eager to learn more about it and use the correct terminology and things to discuss her experiences. Perhaps they could’ve handled it a bit better in the beginning, but given generational/cultural context, I think it went well, and for the most part my sister (whose opinion matters most) thinks the same. \n\nHowever, with all that said, I’m still hesitant to come out to them, mostly because I don’t even know how to describe my sexuality yet. I haven’t found the right “label”, the one that fits the best, but I know it isn’t straight. But that’s made it hard not only to come out to my parents but to come out to my friends and others, as well. I recognize that I have a lot of privilege because for most of my life I’ve been straight-passing, and so I acknowledge and respect my place in the community, but also sometimes my sister will get slightly upset when I speak about “queer” issues (I am only using quotations because I haven’t completely chosen that label for myself yet) and feel the need to clarify what it’s “really like” to be queer because to her, since I haven’t come out yet, I am a “straight ally” whose interest in the queer community appears to be too intense, maybe even performative.

I noticed a commenter identified as middle class, and used that to qualify his belief that rich people should not be discouraged from flaunting their wealth. I respect that viewpoint and I agree that it’s their life to live as they choose. However, the OP of that post described how it felt to be a poor student whose parents can barely put food on the table, as rich students post pictures of their insane meals/vacations. That’s a valid struggle and an important perspective to consider. We can’t ignore the fact that displays of excessive wealth can be hurtful to people who can’t even dream of such privilege. Just because it doesn’t hurt a middle class student who’s okay with not being rich, doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt a student who’s truly struggling to get by. I’m actually surprised that Brown students seem to be very defensive of asserting socioeconomic privilege, while rightly being critical of those who assert other forms of privilege. Here’s my stance on this: If you’re posting pics of a vacation that was super fun, a meal that was really special, or an outfit that’s on point, go right ahead. Rich people are allowed to enjoy good things in their life, including expensive things. I don’t dispute that. Where I draw the line is when the “unattainability” of a vacation, meal, or outfit is the exact reason why it’s being posted on social media.

Sure, we humans are smart. But just as fish need gills or birds need feathers, so did humans need our big, wrinkled brains to survive and evolve as a species. It's not that this had to be; rather, had it not been, we simply would not be. Natural selection and everything we understand about the living world makes this abundantly clear to us. No deity or other artificial ingredients necessary. \n\nNeither faith nor religion are inherently bad. Rather, it is their peddling and merciless solicitation over nearly all of human history that continually pits one ethnic demographic against other perceived adversaries under grandiose delusions of salvation or punishment, leading to unimaginable bloodshed. I personally don't see how these beliefs are in any way helpful in the modern era, considering their undue influence on political ideologies and sociocultural/legal practices. I agree that organized religion can give a sense of comfort or community to many and has been useful in establishing moral codes. However, there are other communities that do this without the need for god-making or empty promises of eternal damnation or VIP penthouse access after we die.\n\nI understand the desire to seek belief in a deity after facing trauma or hardship in life. I, too, suffered a great deal of hardship during my time growing up: physical, emotional and sexual abuse, neglect, poverty, etc. While believing in the totality of the divine could have helped me process that trauma in the short-term, I've found that interrogating the backgrounds and prior experiences of my perpetrators earnestly has been much more productive and lasting. The abuse done to me did not need to be. But only by looking blankly at the histories of those who hurt me could I come to understand how to accept what had been done and achieve closure. Belief in the guiding hand of a deity would have prevented me from properly holding them accountable both within myself and in person. \n\nExistence is lonely. It's not that it's meant to be so. It simply is. And it's beautiful that humanity has striven to create so much here on Earth despite this truth. \"\n","date":"Aug 28, 2019, 2:58 PM"},{"content":"9043 - Can brown dining halls pls serve beyond meat / impossible meat\n","date":"Aug 28, 2019, 2:58 PM"},{"content":"9042 - Nobody is forcing you to hold any political beliefs here.

You had an opportunity to constructively critique OPs arguments, but instead you ironically validated all of their points.\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:36 AM"},{"content":"9026 - real quick before move-in; can someone give me a step by step on how to change the height of the dorm beds please\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:36 AM"},{"content":"9025 - I can't wait for my pimple to meet all of you lovelies\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:36 AM"},{"content":"9024 - anyone know what to expect for the French placement test?\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:36 AM"},{"content":"9023 - Who is the best prof for creative nonfiction?\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:36 AM"},{"content":"9022 - Yo Lizzo fr got robbed at the VMAs\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:36 AM"},{"content":"9021 - Any class recommendations for a senior looking to really soak up final moments of open curriculum?\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:36 AM"},{"content":"9020 - How/Should I take practical/good ECON classes and avoid taking Principles if I've never formally studied econ?\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:36 AM"},{"content":"9019 - When does class registration open again??\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:36 AM"},{"content":"9018 - Anyone know how necessary the access code for computers and music is\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:36 AM"},{"content":"9017 - How important is it to have the exact editions of the books for ENGL 0100F: Devils, Demons, and Do-Gooders?

I remember several mandatory lectures that included arguments against capitalism and things like that. As a fairly liberal person, I wasn’t particularly bothered by what they were saying, but I was concerned about the context. Mandatory orientation events should be focused on promoting healthy habits, mutual respect for your fellow students, etc. Things that are objectively going to make Brown a safer, healthier, more inclusive place. It sends the wrong message to first-years when we “orient” them with controversial or political viewpoints that aren’t objectively true or relevant to being a good member of the Brown community. I trust that every first year has the intelligence to differentiate fact from opinion, so I’m not concerned that orientation will “brainwash” them, and I know that these orientation lectures are done with good intentions. However, I think these events send the message that there’s a very specific political code that Brown students are expected to hold, if they want to fit in socially. I personally have found myself changing my vocabulary to mimic the typical Brown student, in ways that haven’t made my viewpoints any better. I want new students to know that their ideas and identities are welcome here, and that as long as they treat their fellow students with compassion and respect, they belong here. We can debate politics in class, at meals, and in social spaces. All that I ask is we don’t scare new students into hiding their true selves, just to conform to the image of the “ideal Brown student” that they’ve been shown through orientation and may have heard about prior to coming to Brown.\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:34 AM"},{"content":"9011 - How hard is Principle of Economics? - a concerned freshman who has been on reddit lately\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:34 AM"},{"content":"9010 - How demanding is the Brown Orchestra?\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:34 AM"},{"content":"9009 - Difficulty of CLPS 0010?\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:34 AM"},{"content":"9008 - I have an interest in International Relations but zero background in the area.

More specifically, there seem to be two that place heavy emphasis on these factors, while the other two do not. This leads to the unfair and untrue belief that the more elitist sororities are “real sororities” (by the popular societal definition) while the more inclusive ones are just “Brown-style” sororities. Look, I think all four sororities have really great women, and I’m not opposed to them having different philosophies and personalities as organizations. But the rush process clearly divides women not only by personality, but also by social status and identity-related factors. If you look at the more exclusive sororities, you will not only see a racial disparity, but also that the few women of color are often also socioeconomically privileged, while the few low-income and first-gen women are also likely white. In other words, low-income women of color are facing obstacles on two fronts, which is really unjust. This applies to LGBT-identifying women as well. I applaud the more inclusive sororities for fighting back against historical discrimination by accepting diverse groups of women; they deserve to be viewed as equal to the other sororities, not looked down upon for being more inclusive. I hate to say it this way, but it’s very clear that “pretty white girls” benefit immensely from the support and prestige of the sorority system, while others do not. I hope that at the very least, we acknowledge that every sorority is just as real and special as the others, and hopefully the exclusive ones will start to see why being inclusive is much better for the organization and its members.\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:33 AM"},{"content":"8997 - POLS 1500 with Tannenwald doesn't have anything on the Critical Review, does anyone have any insight?\n","date":"Aug 27, 2019, 11:33 AM"},{"content":"8996 - Tips for CLPS 0900?

I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.\n\n“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”\n\n“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”\n\n“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”\n\nThe heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”\n\n“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”\n\n“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”\n\nHe laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”\n\n“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”\n\nI put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.\n\n“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.\n\n“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.\n\n“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”\n\nIt didn’t seem like they did.\n\n“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”\n\nNothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.\n\nI figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.\n\n“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.\n\nToo late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.\n\n“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.\n\nI was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”\n\nHe turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.\n\n“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”\n\n“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.\n\n“Because I was afraid.”\n\n“Afraid?”\n\n“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”\n\nI wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.\n\n“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”\n\nHe nodded, because he knew I was right.

A Republican policymaker might say, well, I can make more money NOW if we enact laws favorable to the oil lobby. A Democratic/progressive/liberal policy would say, well, your future grandkids and other humans will benefit from not doing that. \n\nThis is not to say that thinking about yourself is wrong (it's not inherently a bad thing) or that operating under a collective mindset is good (it isn't always). Its just to say that the amazon is burning because Bolsonaro is an A-hole of epic proportions, and his treatment of indigenous people, the environment, and everything else is likely encouraged by bribes his administration takes from cattle, oil and other lobbies. We can see a ton of parallels, though often less extreme than an actual fire burning the lungs of the world, in Trump, the US republican party, and lobbyists here.

Example: I've heard people say that it's worth the risk of losing school children sometimes to gun violence because the US Constitution protects the right to bear arms. (Although I've seen other people use the Constitution to protect the right to vote). Example: Fossil fuel companies that are literally destroying out planet and committing violence against communities and protestors in the process because of an ideology of profit. (Although, I've seen people use money to run renewable energy businesses that empower people and the environment). Example: Race being interpreted into believing in white supremacy. (Although I've also seen people interpret the concept of race to celebrate, empower, create community, understand collective experience, and fight for equality). Example: Understanding a nation to justify violence at the border and family separation. (Although I've also seen people use an understanding of a nation to be pluralist and welcoming of immigrants). Moral: people are capable of doing good and bad things and are capable of being brainwashed into following extremist views with AND without religion. Religion (which I understand to be human systems to engage with the divine), along with being abused to bring out evil, harm, violence, oppression, etc has also produced incredible kindness, generosity, hope, and persistence that reveals all the best in humanity. And I want to say that whether faith is \"\"organized religion\"\" or unorganized personal spirituality, both can be valid and beautiful and both can end up with dangerous results (e.g., The use of organized Christianity in the Black Church during Civil Rights organizing and more recently the revival of the Poor People's Campaign VS the use of organized Christianity to colonize what is currently known as North America). As for dealing with difficult texts that can be interpreted for good or for evil, I think we can acknowledge hard passages and the history of how texts and theology have been used to cause harm and their capacity to do so in the future, and this is an important thing to do. People are always going to believe in things, whether that's the divine, money, social divisions, etc. I'm not saying any of those things are on the same plane, but just that there are non-divine belief systems that can be used for good or evil. So I'm personally more interested in how people deal with power and inequality and how they can use belief systems to engage with power and inequality, rather in arguing whether religion is inherently flawed because I know we as people are always going to believe in something.\n","date":"Aug 23, 2019, 2:08 PM"},{"content":"8876 - What is the best place around campus for eyebrow threading?\n","date":"Aug 23, 2019, 2:08 PM"},{"content":"8875 - topics: reslife\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAnyone down to go to the res life office with me and discretely take a massive leak on the ground and then immediately dip thereafter?\n","date":"Aug 23, 2019, 2:08 PM"},{"content":"8874 - topics: reslife\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nreslife, yet another failed experiment in communism\n","date":"Aug 23, 2019, 2:08 PM"},{"content":"8873 - Can cannibalism be vegan if the person gives you consent to eat them?\n","date":"Aug 23, 2019, 2:08 PM"},{"content":"8872 - topics: housing questions\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nWho's in Grad Center B fifth floor?\n","date":"Aug 23, 2019, 2:08 PM"},{"content":"8871 - What is the highest starting salary I can get out of college and is that (are those) firm(s) still hiring?

You can defend someone’s right to their beliefs without defending their beliefs. If someone argues that the Quran is problematic, replying with “the Bible is also problematic” is not a valid argument. Ofc the Bible is problematic. Religion itself is problematic, and not just because of specific theological views or ancient outdated laws, but because the very practice of worshipping a specified, codified divine being will almost certainly inspire some form of extremism among some subgroup of a religion’s followers. I support religious freedom, and I do think that when we’re talking about Islam specifically, it’s a complicated issue because there’s so much Islamophobia and hatred in this country right now, but I also think it’s important to critique religions and the concept of religion itself, particularly given its impact throughout history.\n","date":"Aug 19, 2019, 9:38 AM"},{"content":"8779 - topics: reslife\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nabolish reslife yall\n","date":"Aug 19, 2019, 9:38 AM"},{"content":"8778 - Who's in Caswell 1st floor?\n","date":"Aug 17, 2019, 10:20 PM"},{"content":"8777 - Would anyone on campus openly self-identify as a communist?

Still, thank you for sharing your opinion and bringing up a common islamophobic perspective that the media pushes and I’m sure others on campus accept. \n\nWhen it comes to the “women’s testimony counting as half that of the mans” concept, the Quran mentions this in the context of two men serving as witnesses when muslims are contracting one another for a debt. And if there aren’t two men available to contract this debt, then the Quran says one man and two women. The quran specifically explains why it has two women serve as witnesses instead of just one- ‘so that if one forgets the other can remind her.’ Even if this reason doesn’t seem strong, there are two things that I as a Muslim take to consideration when understanding the text: 1) there must be a scientific/wise reason behind this and 2) the time difference. In terms of scientific reasoning numerous studies have shown that women are disproportionately at risk for quick memory impairment and dementia postmenopause for instance. So to me that helps me make some sense of the explanation God gave. And in terms of the second point you totally neglect addressing that this was the revelation from 1440 years ago. \nSo, as a feminist myself I see my faith as progressive especially in a time when women didn’t have any power or say in testifying. It is quite liberating and progressive actually to see that women had any say in testifying in regards to debt/wealth contracts at a time when most dare I say all women of other societies had no say. \n\nIn fact, Islam gave a woman the right to inheritance before any other major religion/society did. In Islam, women inherit half of what a man does with the woman being given the privilege of keeping all the money to herself while the man is tasked with spending that money on his family and the women in his life. Islam also had women serve as scholars and teachers to the community with one of the most renowned scholar around the time of the prophet pbuh being a woman. And in his last speech to the people (and throughout his lifetime), the Prophet Mohamed (pbuh) emphasized the importance of honoring women so much that his enemies criticized him for being a feminist. \n\nWhat often happens in the ‘majority muslim’ countries OP talks about is that rulers and individuals who are pro-patriarchy utilize the media’s rhetoric to their benefit by positing their own biases and cultural practices as belonging to the Islamic faith. People who want to misinterpret a text can take something out of context and base their own backward ideas on it. The media strategically tells people to do as you say and focus on the sexism in majority muslim countries to try to make American women feel as though the sexism here is non existent. Here we have yet to provide women equal pay for equal service. Here as a society we objectify women in movies, games and in general. Here we he have yet to have a female president while many muslim majority countries already have. So OP American feminists have more than every right to protest this misogyny. \n\nI wear the hijab loud and proud firstly because it is a command in the Quran but also because when I wear it helps me have people focus on my actions and personality rather than my appearance and body. Billie Eilish’s reason for dressing the way she does resonates a lot with me as a Muslim woman who chooses to dress modestly. All in all hijab gives me the freedom to not feel much of the harassment that society thinks is okay to show women. It makes me feel that I’m a treasure and queen whose physical appearance and inner appearance can only be seen by those whom I choose. That is a snippet of what my hijab means to me. \n\nSo please please please, in general, when you don’t understand someone else’s beliefs don’t jump to bashing them but rather ask and learn from people with the beliefs. It is very easy to look up this information on a website that is islamophobic and shares your perspective. It makes you feel stronger and solidifies your incorrect views. Instead try to ask a Muslim for example (of course we don’t all have the complete knowledge to explain it) but I for one love being asked questions about my faith because it gives me a chance to educate others while learning more about my own limitations in knowledge, etc. In this day and age especially we need to love and learn from each other’s differences. If any other muslim students on campus want to contribute to this discussion to share various muslim perspectives please do. Feel free to correct me if you believe I did not explain something too great. Thank you for reading up to this point if you did.\n","date":"Aug 17, 2019, 10:05 PM"},{"content":"8712 - What are the hardest courses at brown?\n","date":"Aug 17, 2019, 10:04 PM"},{"content":"8711 - Does anyone have photos of what the suites look like in New dorm?

Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength.

His rhetoric has never really changed, and you can see more of his standard attacks and lies throughout that article.\n\nMore recently, on the Republican debate stage for the 2016 election, he backs up this statement and goes on to call Tiananmen Square a riot. He was also already being called out for his love for Authoritarians.\n\nSee: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzJDFX8Ya7w\n\nHe says he doesn't endorse their behavior while constantly endorsing their behavior.

This is who he is, a vile violent power hungry husk of a human being.\n\nAccording to the President of the United States - it is okay for tanks to run people over, and for troops to gun down unarmed civilians if they're \"\"rioting\"\" or really, you just have to call it a \"\"riot\"\" and that works for them.\n\nThey are preparing to murder people.

If we’re going to be sex positive, I don’t think it makes sense to argue that sexual attraction has to be dependent on personality alone, or that it’s somehow immature if connected to physical characteristics. Personally, I’ve experimented with my sexuality and found that the type of sex that I enjoy requires my partner to have a penis. I don’t enjoy most penetrative sex and I’m not interested in strap-ons. \n\nOften in these discussions, the argument is raised that someone who doesn’t want to have sex with a trans person because of their genitals is being transphobic by equating gender with genitals. I think this is problematic, however, because it relies upon the assumption that penises are male and vaginas are female, that there is some incongruence inherent in trans people’s bodies that needs to be resolved by cis partners having sex with us. \n\nAlso, I understand that trans perspectives differ widely on this issue (and I really want to understand how other people think about this), and I certainly can’t speak for all trans people (plus many trans people have had gender confirmation surgery).\n","date":"Aug 14, 2019, 1:46 PM"},{"content":"8638 - I'm looking to obtain a white board with a grid on it, preferably 1 inch squares.

I had hoped that coming to Brown would have helped, but after spending time with my family this summer, I can remember exactly why I get so panicked and anxious whenever there are people that are just too drunk. Bad things have happened repeatedly in my past from people I care a lot about and can't avoid in spaces where alcohol is somewhat normalized, just because some people were so wasted they had no idea what they were doing, and who they were doing it to. I love going out and having fun, but I feel like whenever I'm at Brown this fear stops me from actually being able to participate in a lot of social events. Obviously, you don't need to drink to have fun, but I feel terrible declining invites from friends every single time because I literally can't breathe when I imagine being around so many people that are drinking and not thinking clearly. This, in addition to the fact that a lot of people I was around last year constantly bragged about their frequent \"\"blackouts\"\" on their nights out have made me scared to even try, and I barely went to any parties last year even though I was really looking forward to meeting new people and having fun.\n\nI guess it's my fault for not being brave enough to tell others why, but I feel like I'm not strong enough to even admit why to myself, much less to others. The only time I've tried to mention it up to others it was dismissed as me \"\"seeing the situation inaccurately because I was too young to understand those acts.\"\" I'd much rather not acknowledge it, and even as I type this I'm shaking in fear that people will find out who I am because of the vague excuses I've given. I want to be okay drinking in moderation and being around people that aren't sober, but every time I think I've made progress, I freeze up when someone says something like \"\"I can't even remember what I did last night haha hope it wasn't too crazy,\"\" because I was the only one left with those memories over and over again, when painful things did happen. And I never said anything or tried to stop what happened because they were in an absolute position of power, but especially because they are genuinely kind and good people when sober (who have no idea what they've done) that I love and respect so much. When I hear people talk like that at Brown, at best I feel uncomfortable, and at worst I feel like I'm just going to hyperventilate and cry. I've tried SoBear and I've tried actively trying to be friends with people who don't drink or party, but I feel like I've missed out on so many friendships when they invite me out and I have to make up some excuse, and then I kind of lose contact with them. Or I'll be with them when they're discussing other people who are too \"\"boring\"\" or \"\"uptight\"\" to go out, and I'll realize that that's what they'll think about me when I inevitably can't go out with them all the time. \n\nI don't want to have to avoid alcohol forever. I actually want to have safe, non-sober experiences, so I can replace this instinctive \"\"drunk = panic = possibly hurting those you love\"\" idea in my mind, but the partying culture here just makes it so hard to start explaining, and the idea of making myself vulnerable again terrifies me more than I can describe. I guess I just want some advice on how to get over this, because I know it's stunting my relationships with other people, and my social life. I mean, we're in college, and I know I need to move on instead of wasting my time being scared, but it won't go away.\n\ni also have no idea why i posted this on dear blueno, so sorry. i started writing this to get it out and the emotions just...kept going.\n","date":"Aug 11, 2019, 2:30 PM"},{"content":"8589 - yang gang\n","date":"Aug 10, 2019, 12:48 PM"},{"content":"8588 - Is it possible to concentrate in CS starting sophomore year?

For what? If you have the privilege to be seen as human by “both sides,” you should be using that privilege to advocate radical policies that will actually change the way the government works. \nUnder capitalism, we have been taught that people succeed or fail, based on how hard they work and how good their ideas are. Of course this isn’t true, but it works to maintain the belief that poor people deserve to be where they are, that some people will live unhappy, difficult lives and there is nothing we can do about it. Even if it was the case that people’s success is entirely dependent on their own work/ideas, even in an ideal capitalist state, you would have to believe that people who are unable to work or come up with good ideas are therefore useless to society. This is a very dangerous belief. \n\n“Centrism isn’t about compromise, it’s about considering issues from all angles and figuring out which ideas are the best.”\n\nIf you are able to consider the issues we are facing from all sides, you probably have a fair amount of privileged. Someone who holds a marginalized identity probably doesn’t want to consider the alt-right’s idea that x identity renders someone inhuman and undeserving of fundamental rights. So let’s say you are relatively privileged. This is not a bad thing. But it does mean that you have access to potentially more dangerous beliefs, and that your need to consider those beliefs, even if your immediate response is “no, I don’t think we should kill poc,” should be called into question. The fact that you can consider those ideas without being harmed by them means you have a certain level of power. Why aren’t you willing to give it up? Why do you want to have access, the theoretical choice, to be racist, sexist, xenophobic, etc? If you have something to lose, chances are you won’t share the racist meme, or laugh off your aunt’s homophobic comment, or stay casual friends with the guy from high school who likes Ben Shapiro. \n\nMaybe I’m getting too deep into identity politics. Let’s talk about socially liberal, fiscally conservative centrists. If you have considered every perspective, and I mean this sincerely, how have you ended up with this combination of beliefs? There is a reason that marginalized people are skewed to the left—fiscal conservatism does not account for us. It does not protect us. You may want us to be treated equally, but you prioritize stasis and the rights of corporations over the access of the individual to goods and services. A corporation can’t be treated under the law as equivalent to a person. A business, abstracted from its employees, is a fiction, a mythic gestalt which is less than a person. A business, when viewed only as a collection of people, does not have the same skin in the game as the consumer. Being forced to offer services to a queer person, or a person of color, or an immigrant is, at worst, a violation of the business’s beliefs. In the case of the myth, the business is not a person and has no beliefs. If viewed as a collection of people, even in the case that all of these people have the same beliefs, their beliefs don’t matter as much as the consumer’s livelihood.\n\nPersonally, I think this is the same whether the business is selling water or a wedding cake, because it has to be the same, because if it isn’t the same we have to figure out which products are necessary and which businesses are allowed to deny to people they don’t like, and the only reason this argument is being had is because some fiscal conservatives believe all beliefs, including discriminatory beliefs, are legitimate and equal, which is mildly philosophically relevant, but in the real world, dangerous and (bet you weren’t expecting this one, centrists) IMPRACTICAL :)\n\nTldr; if you are a centrist, you are helping the fascists more than you are helping poor people, because your belief that poor people shouldn’t get fucked over probably isn’t backed up by policies which help poor people, and if it is, then you probably either aren’t a centrist or just don’t like pc culture, which is fair, but also understand that if you haven’t been constrained/traumatized (and I mean this very seriously/literally; I do think that the word “trauma” is one place where pc culture has fucked up a bit) by language, your feeling that people care too much about words and labels rn comes from a place of privilege. Also some people do just want to be right about what word you’re using when, and I get that that’s annoying, but you can also try to understand where they’re coming from, because, as a centrist, that’s like,,,, what you do\n","date":"Aug 5, 2019, 1:35 PM"},{"content":"8478 - topics: politics\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI’m fiscally liberal and socially conservative.

Bernie Sanders was an independent for much of his political career. Independents are often people who just don’t want to subscribe to a predetermined set of views. Between moderate and centrist, I believe centrist is probably the more problematic ideology, although personally I think people can label themselves however they please. Moderate implies that you’ve chosen a side, but you haven’t gone all-in. Centrist implies that you’re dead center, which probably means you think bipartisan agreement is more important than doing the right thing. Being a moderate seems a bit more organic, in the sense that you have a side but maybe are hesitant to fully embrace that side, while being a centrist seems like a conscious decision to stick yourself right in the middle.\n","date":"Aug 4, 2019, 11:51 PM"},{"content":"8443 - topics: centrism\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI understand that’s it’s problematic to promote centrism/moderation as being the right answer. However, I think many comments have been unfair in a number of ways. For example, I don’t think many independents are “half-way” on the question of whether LGBTQ people deserve equal rights. Many may be “half-way” on tax cuts, welfare spending, and gun control, from what I’ve seen at Brown, and maybe these views are wrong. But it is entirely possible to hold moderate views on these issues while still being firmly supportive of equality and justice on less debatable issues. In other words, unless you’ve met a centrist at Brown who didn’t fully support LGBTQ rights, don’t just assume that centrists at Brown don’t support LGBTQ rights.\n","date":"Aug 4, 2019, 11:51 PM"},{"content":"8442 - Most of us on campus are moderates, not warmongering, hateful Republicans or snowflake Democrats.

But for one, Endor seemed like a pretty worthless place to the empire and once the Death Star outgrew its shield and was ready to stand on its own what use would they really have had for the rest of the moon. For two, even if the rebels thought that they were ultimately helping the Ewoks by ridding the moon of the Empire they still got a lot of them killed under false pretenses, robbing them agency, and if they had failed who knows what reprisals the empire would have prosecuted against the Ewoks.

I get it's just a stupid facebook page but it has 2k+ followers and I know a bunch of people that don't follow it but still read the posts, so I would imagine that number is even more. This page played a role in both Buxton and Sigma being kicked off campus; thousands suddenly knew the (very private) details of what happened, which, for better or worse, never would have happened before this page. I also think it is an absolute cesspool of false rumors, some of which are made up by trolls and some by people maliciously intending to target a student group or faculty member. Finally, we have no idea what is being censored; for all we know, there is a similar story of hazing in the Brown band to the story of sigma that someone tried to post, but the mods did not post it (obviously I don't actually believe the Brown band hazes, but you get my point). \n\nI'm not sure if I have a solution to this, but it's something that has been bothering me recently. We also have no idea if all of these things are actually submitted- a mod can post literally whatever they want and say it came from a submission (this isn't that important because a mod could just submit anything anonymously and then post it, but they could do this with a very controversial take that a different mod might not post). Lastly, I'm 98% this is the same moderator team as (new) BBA- that is a lot of social media influence for some members of the Brown community. \n\nLook at the pinned post on the meal plan, for example. That is the first thing that everyone who looks at this page. While everyone might agree the meal plan sucks, it still shows that the moderators are taking a stand of any kind; it also sets a dangerous precedent of the moderators exerting their own opinions in a debate.

Also Manafort giving polling data to Russians.\n2. ⁠Dems aren’t doomed in 2020 if it fails. Clinton’s acquittal in Feb 1999 was followed by Bush winning the presidency. Clinton didn’t even get an approval bump after it.\n\nhttps://news.gallup.com/poll/116584/presidential-approval-ratings-bill-clinton.aspx\n\nEvery President who has been impeached (including Nixon’s likely impeachment) resulted in the opposition party winning the presidency. Democrat Johnson was followed by Republican Grant. Republican Nixon was followed by Democrat Carter. Democrat Clinton was followed by Republican Bush.\n\n3. Trump’s name needs to go on the list of impeached presidents. He’s far worse than most. The narrative from people not paying attention will be “if he’s so bad why wasn’t he impeached like Clinton?” The majority of voters are not political news addicts. But they’ll all hear the word “impeachment” and some may decide to move on from all the smoke and chaos in their country when it’s time to vote.\n\n4. Nixon had high approval ratings when impeachment talk started. The pretrial hearings brought out the facts to the public eye and everyone turned on him.\n\n5. Raising the likelihood of prosecution after he’s out of office, or his children, may cause him to cut a deal to leave office.\n\n6. There’s still a chance of conviction. People may turn on their senators once all the facts are blown up and a case is made. Nixon’s impeachment talk started when he had high approval ratings.\n\n7. Barr’s word shouldn’t be the final say on this. He’s proven to be a cover-up artist.\n\n8. It needs to be established that improper actions will be fought against to the fullest extent to deter future candidates from trying to steal elections.\n\n9. Impeachment will be open to other issues that Mueller’s investigation was not like emoluments violations, conduct unbecoming of the presidency, tax violations, campaign finance violations, paying off pornstars to influence an election, wasting tax payer dollars on personal trips and benefiting financially from them, siding with Russia over US intelligence, separating families at the border, defrauding students at his university, ignoring Russia’s attack on our elections, attacking the press, attacking members of the judicial and legislative branches in order to control them, etc.\n\n10. Trump uses lies, Fox News, and fake news. All that falls apart in a trial under oath. Get their damning testimonies on video and play clips around the clock. How many times have we seen Clinton’s “I did not have sexual relations with that woman”?\n\n11. Impeachment may bring out more reason to examine his taxes and other financial documents.\n\n12. Trump already convinced his base that Mueller exonerated him and it didn’t win over any Americans. A second “exoneration” will be meaningless. Everyone knows Republican senators won’t convict. Put them all on record supporting the president with the lowest approval ratings in modern history after the damning facts have been laid out. Republican and Independent supporters of the rule of law will turn against them. It will also hurt any chances of a Presidential run for any senators that vote to acquit.\n\n13. Impeachment will be a game changer. It’s a household word, and it has only happened twice before. People that normally don’t pay attention will tune in just for the historical aspect. This will lead to greater support for impeachment as they learn the facts.\n\nBonus: here’s a powerful video of some former high ranking republicans speaking with conviction that Trump committed obstruction of justice\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwnMpneFR34&feature=player_embedded https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/cha9e7/discussion_thread_robert_mueller_testifies_before/euqu16e\n","date":"Jul 25, 2019, 12:10 AM"},{"content":"8229 - I applied and was accepted to the Third World Transition Program, but I'm having reservations about attending.

Franken was stung by Gillibrand’s failure to call him personally. They had been friends and squash partners. In a later call, Gillibrand’s chief of staff offered to have Gillibrand speak with Franken, but by that time Franken was frantically conferring with his staff and his family. Franken’s office proposed that Franken’s daughter speak with Gillibrand instead, but Gillibrand declined.\n\nGillibrand then went on Facebook and posted her demand that Franken resign: “Enough is enough. The women who have come forward are brave and I believe them. While it’s true that his behavior is not the same as the criminal conduct alleged against Roy Moore, or Harvey Weinstein, or President Trump, it is still unquestionably wrong, and should not be tolerated.”\n\nMinutes later, at a previously scheduled press conference, Gillibrand added insult to injury: she reiterated her call for Franken to resign while also trumpeting her sponsorship of a new bill that banned mandatory arbitration of sexual-harassment claims. She didn’t mention that Franken had originated the legislation—and had given it to Gillibrand to sponsor, out of concern that it might be imperilled by his scandal.”\n\nWhat a cheap play. I hope Gilibrand is ostracized by the dems and resigns instead of running for re-election. Using this -now rightfully disparaged- scandal to elevate herself for her joke of a presidential run instead of actually supporting an investigation shows how much of a conniving snake she is.

I'm just thinking about the cost of tuition, and I'm trying to figure out how exactly $60,000 is used to give an English, history, or Latin student a year of education. In many STEM fields, there are huge costs involved with maintaining labs, equipment, and materials. While there's certainly humanities research that needs funding, most humanities classes really don't involve any expenses other than professor salary. Unlike engineering, which requires a hands on education, I feel that many humanities topics could be studied independent of a university, maybe through reading and/or online education.\n\nSo why does this matter? I think this comes into play when people worry about free college for all. There's nothing wrong or impractical about a Brown student studying Eastern European literature or South Asian philosophy. These are interesting topics and these students will find a way to apply their unique educations to real-world jobs.

In recent discussions about student loan forgiveness, a lot of posters have been pushing the idea that STEM students would be subsidizing students who made less “responsible” choices with their majors, thus making it unfair. Now, I’m personally undecided on the student loan forgiveness issue for other reasons, but this argument just doesn’t make sense.\n\nIf you visit this website https://www.brown.edu/undergraduate_concentrations you can check out what students in each concentration are doing 5-10 years after graduating. If you take a look at gender studies, the major a lot of posters have been singling out, some of the top fields students are going into include medicine, law, higher education, and others that tend to pay relatively well. The idea that humanities/ non-STEM students don’t have well-paying job opportunities is just simply untrue. There’s also the fact that plenty of people end up in jobs that are totally unrelated to their major. Ask any adult well into their career and there’s a decent chance they’ll say what they studied in college has very little to do with what they do for work now.\n\nMajoring in a STEM field doesn’t guarantee you a high-paying job and majoring in other fields—even fields some consider “useless”—doesn’t doom you financially. This idea discourages less economically advantaged students from studying what they’re passionate about and leads people to feel guilty for studying what they love. Not everyone goes to college for the same reason. Some people go with the goal of securing a job that pays the highest amount possible and others will focus more on using the opportunity to learn for the sake of learning. There’s nothing wrong with either motivation, and the latter shouldn’t be reserved for wealthy students only.\n\nWhile the link above is Brown specific, there is plenty of evidence that shows degree-holders in general vastly out-earn those without degrees. In short, what you major in doesn’t determine your future career or earnings, so the STEM/ humanities debate shouldn’t really be taken into account in the student loan forgiveness discussion.\"\n","date":"Jul 21, 2019, 12:52 PM"},{"content":"\"8123 - topics: student loan reforms\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nimagine that you are a person struggling with a serious illness. you have suffered through it for years and years and now there is a cure for the illness. are you going to oppose other people receiving the same treatment because that meant your suffering meant less? now, imagine that the illness is student loans.\"\n","date":"Jul 21, 2019, 12:51 PM"},{"content":"8122 - Senior and CS15 and Corp fin Profs are racist\n","date":"Jul 21, 2019, 12:51 PM"},{"content":"\"8121 - topics: student loan reform\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nIf you major in something that’s not gonna bring you good income to pay off your loans, don’t expect other people to pay them off for you.

You should be accepted for who you are.\n\nBut what's so bad about not being physically attracted to fat people?\n\nIf the argument is that what is attractive is based on culture and not being attracted to fat people is learned then fine. I think people should be able to live how they want without being shamed in person or in media. I'm certainly not going to read my kids bedtime stories at night about how the obese are going to come and take them away to a gingerbread house in the forest to fatten and eat them if they don't eat their vegetables.\n\nBut that doesn't change the fact that many people are not attracted to fat people. That's just the rub. Saying they are wrong and fat-phobic for that just boggles my mind. A fat and thin person's face and body might be more different than the body and face of a cis-guy and a cis-girl. I don't get why people HAVE to be PHYSICALLY ATTRACTED to both of the former pair but it's fine to be PHYSICALLY ATTRACTED to one of the latter pair. A large difference in size, proportions, feel (idk whatever your body feels like when someone touches it) and face shape seems about as significant as the choice between a relatively tiny variably hard and soft appendage and on average a few inches of height or an extra self lubricating hole and some extra chest and butt fat.\n\nPeople are allowed to find some things attractive and some things unattractive. Hook noses, crooked teeth, a face covered in pimples, too masc, too fem, too androgynous etc. There is always going to be a spectrum of attractiveness individually defined by each person.

That's their choice.\n\nMost Americans, however, have children to feed, bills to pay, loans to pay, businesses to start, etc. You're not entitled to a slice of money, because you decided to study something that wasn't going to pay itself off. You get to study what you want, but you have no right to demand OTHER people's money to fund it. If I wanted to buy an NVIDIA GPU to play games and run my deep learning models and I came to you asking for you to fund even a dollar of it, would you? What makes you think that you're entitled to my money, then? I could even argue that the GPU does society good; maybe it increases my productivity in other things. That's something that gets compensated in my wages, not by asking the government for money.\n\nYour decisions are your decisions, and the consequences are your responsibility. When you borrow money, you make a promise to pay it off. We shouldn't have a society that encourages people to break their promises.\n\nFrom a different angle, consider how a blanket forgiveness program would make those who spent decades struggling with and paying off their loans. Undoubtedly, there is a certain feeling of accomplishment after the last payment. These people would have watched their peers spend money and pay no heed to their loans end up in the same place.

They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.\n\n(-Courtesy of a friend)\"\n","date":"Jul 19, 2019, 10:31 PM"},{"content":"8080 - I haven't seen my friends since school ended, but even though it is summer, I periodically wonder if they even like me.

Until we have the ability to have an actual dialogue about race, the conversation will continue to be just be a shouting match.

Just think it's better to discuss student debt forgiveness based on facts rather than cheap shots at gender studies majors, though I will admit the latter has much higher entertainment value.\n","date":"Jul 16, 2019, 7:21 PM"},{"content":"8041 - I hate to be the one to ask, but what the fuck is oatmeal?\n\nBottom Text\n","date":"Jul 16, 2019, 7:21 PM"},{"content":"8040 - topics: student loan reform, stem/humanities spiciness\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI agree w/ the people saying people with bullshit degrees shouldn't get student loan repayment, but I have a bigger issue with student loan repayment. \n\nFirst of all, gender studies improves society??? Someone please explain how. Chemistry majors improve society by helping us develop new medicine, computer science majors improve society by building the technologies we use everyday, and political science majors improve society by keeping our government functioning. Can someone explain to me the value of these 'less practical' majors?\n\nMy other qualm with this discussion is performance. Let's say student A and student B have the same major. Student A works their ass off, graduates with great grades, relevant extracurriculars, and stellar recommendations and gets a great job. Student B slacks off, smokes weed all the time and gets drunk when they should be in class, doesn't get involved in anything outside the classroom, and doesn't talk to an entire professor throughout their 4 years at Brown. Student A is going to end up with a far, far better job than student B, regardless of major. If they are both CS majors, it may be that A gets a 200k job while B gets a 75k job, or if they're both (insert unemployable major), A may get 35k and B 20k. The major doesn't matter; A will end up in a better job than B.\n\nLet's say A continues this hard work for the next 5 years, gets promoted, gets raises, and so on. They are super frugal, don't spend any money on frivolous things like luxury goods/drugs/alcohol/etc, and focus 100% on paying off student loans, and is able to take a big chunk out of those loans in those 5 years. Again, there are some fields were A might be able to finish them completely in 5 years, and other fields where they still might not be even close, but my point is A is doing their best to pay down these loans. Let's say B continues their pattern. They slack off at work and get fired/go to a worse firm because it's easier/don't get promoted/don't get raises/etc, spend every paycheck as soon as it comes on weed, expensive alcohol, and gucci clothes, and make no progress to repaying their loans. How is it that we should completely ignore all of the hard work of A that has led them to being able to pay off those loans when we repay the loans of B? A chose to spend their college years at the sci li instead of at the Whiskey Republic to better their chances of getting a good job, and made financial sacrifices out of college to pay down their loans. B did none of that, but they will come out of it the same? How is that fair?\n","date":"Jul 16, 2019, 7:21 PM"},{"content":"8039 - Hi there, I realize that I could really benefit from having an ESA and probably really need one, but 1) I'm not from around providence and can't take a pet home for breaks (parent w/ allergies) and 2) I don't have enough income to be able to pay for any unexpected expenses, take it to the vet if it gets sick, etc.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for how I can get comparable mental health benefits to those of having an ESA, since that seems to not be an option for me?\n","date":"Jul 16, 2019, 7:21 PM"},{"content":"8038 - @8021, wheymen.\n","date":"Jul 16, 2019, 7:21 PM"},{"content":"\"8037 - Idk if this makes any sense at all or its just a rant but does anyone feel existentially confused at Brown because of how many mixed messages we get here from one another?

People who want to go into finance or whatever like that are judged for being sell outs, but you’re also judged if you want to go into a nonprofit or something because people see you as not meeting your potential. People at Brown are chill and friendly, but at the same time there’s like no sense of school spirit and I find it hard to make close friends here.

Idk its just like is that the hill you want to die on? Im going to go ahead and assume that most people who have expressed discomfort with the flag are liberal because of the focus on immigration, imperialism, and nationalism (sorry if this assumption is wrong).

I understand that people don't want to give up on issues important to them, but at some point we have to prioritize what we actually want to get done and how to get the votes to make it happen and if that means giving up on the flag discourse, i think its a small price to pay.\n","date":"Jul 12, 2019, 3:52 PM"},{"content":"7965 - Sometimes I think Brown sucks and that’s why I’m not happy to be here, but then I go somewhere else for the summer and I remember— I’m just dissatisfied with my life, and I happen to spend a lot of it at Brown.

I see it as such a difficult question. Like how do you ensure “fairness” to the majority cis women competitors without discriminating against individuals for aspects about their body that they can’t control? And it’s further complicated by the fact that some cis women have naturally elevated testosterone levels that are comparable to men’s - Caster Semenya, for example. So what do we do? Should it not be about gender at all - just that some bodies have more innate athletic capacity than others? But then again that seems unfair, considering that the majority of biologically female bodies face physical speed/strength/etc limitations compared to biologically male bodies.

But if we continue to let nationalists, war hawks, fascists, etc. co-opt the flag without pushing back on it, aren't we just letting them say that the American flag (and by extension America) stands for oppression and aggression, now and in the future? I feel it would be better in the long run if we put energy into telling white nationalists to stop attaching it to bigotry rather than telling people not to attach it to good things our country has done (like winning soccer games), given that it is a ubiquitous symbol that *will not go away* in the forseeable future of our country, regardless of what it has stood for in the past. Of course this should go along with actually trying to make our country better, not just improving the optics. However, I'm white (and so is the author of the tweets I linked as far as I can tell) so American nationalism has bothered me but never threatened me, and I would be very receptive to people telling me why this is the wrong approach!\n","date":"Jul 10, 2019, 8:16 PM"},{"content":"7906 - LOONA for Spring Weekend 2020!!!!!\n","date":"Jul 10, 2019, 8:16 PM"},{"content":"7905 - topics: race\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nTo the poster who was disheartened to see brown boys acting like shit — most of these dudes you see are whitewashed as hell 🤷🏻‍♀️ most brown boys honestly ain’t shit! \n\nSigned, a brown girl\n","date":"Jul 10, 2019, 8:16 PM"},{"content":"7904 - Share this!!!

America is far from perfect, but that doesn’t mean patriotism should be seen as offensive. Nationalism can be twisted into the disturbed notion that America is “better.” Truthfully, a country who does not let you down will be the first. Most important is patriotism and having faith that we as a nation will progress and become a better place to live for our children and childrens’ children. That is, after all, what countless men and women have died for, is our ability to pursue our freedoms together as a nation. I apologize for the excessive cliche, but the flag reminds me that my uncle died in Afghanistan serving our country, that my grandparents came here for better lives, and that I have the ability and the duty to make this nation better. Taking offense and hiding that symbol is absolutely pointless and exactly why the right wing takes jabs at supposed liberal sensitivity. What is helpful is letting it be an inspiration. So I post the flag proudly and chant USA. I don’t mean to offend anyone who has been hurt by this nation, but I mean to promote the things that unite us.

Ultimately, it will all backfire, because people are being hired with weaker credentials, less talent, and fewer skills just to please various quotas. Then the next generation will be even worse off. And those [women] who are hired without proper skills will not be sincerely respected. In fact, they will make people question any woman (or black, various other minorities, etc.) It's really sad. The truth is that for many reasons very few women have been interested in composition and theory. And the truth is also that we won't be able to \"\"correct\"\" this historical fact by just hiring a bunch of women. We can't just *make* people interested in something that they often don't want to do. But that is what so many schools are trying to do. I would go even further and say that there is no inherent problem with having a very heavy presence of white males in the field. After all, they (we) are the ones who CREATED the entire field (and Western Civilization!). Do we also need an equal proportion of white males doing Latin music or making Chinese opera? Of course, nobody would suggest anything like that. But it is what it is.

Other mainstream Democrat politicians (Biden, Warren, Beto, Harris, Booker, Castro, Gillibrand, maybe Sanders too) are calling for more freedom and moral rights, but all they're trying to do is to create dictatorship. They're trying to impose their standards on others, curtail freedom of speech, and create a society of equal outcome, not equal opportunity. They're socialists, not capitalists, and we are no Russia. After all, while I know some of y'all support one of these candidates, they already lost support from the moderates and are made fun of. \n\nWhat I like about Yang, on the other hand, is that he doesn't appeal for emotions or a small group of voters. He works with numbers and attracts average middle class Americans, the group that actually got Trump elected in 2016. His $1000 income plan still doesn't sound the most logical to me but his reasoning does make sense and he is the only sensible guy who knows the economy and the future. (In fact, I don't think anyone seriously discussed economy in the debates, God knows why.) Some people also fail to realize that the conservatives also hold respect for Yang and take him seriously, unlike other candidates whom they watched in the Democratic debates purely for entertainment purposes. After all, the majority of Americans care about, but not enough about feminism, illegal immigration, gay rights, etc. They care most about how to support their families and loved ones. \n\nI consider myself a conservative. Personally, I think Trump, though not perfect, has done a fine job for the past 4 years. At least a lot better than Hillary. I know his approval rating has never risen above 50% (it actually hit a high a couple days ago), but we have witnessed the upset in 2016, and should remain skeptical about the media and its statistics. All I know is that he has not quite disappointed his supporters too much and has a fair chance for the re-election in 2020. \n\nHowever, Trump still is not the ideal president for America. I would like to see someone better win the next election and bring more positive influence. But, I honestly wouldn't mind Trump 2020 should the Democrats really elect one of the socialists as their candidate. In fact, so far things are going well for Trump.

It's really cool to see people think about how they can sell something that empowers both themselves as business leaders and empowers their buyers. and i'm proud of my friends studying econ who care a lot about education finance, responsible investing, health care finance, etc.\n","date":"Jul 8, 2019, 12:49 PM"},{"content":"7830 - topics: chief discourse\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAs much as I love Brown students, I’m disappointed at yet another example of the well-meaning absurdity that comes out of social justice discussions.

We had many a deep conversation about coming out, life and existence, and politics. We've never met in person, but we've FaceTimed a few times. We really do seem to be on the same page. He's essentially in love with me. It's very common for him to, over snapchat, tell me how much I've helped him become less internally homophobic and how I've opened him up to the idea of being out of the closet as gay. He used to incessantly tell me how cute i was until I told him it was annoying. At least once or twice a week, he'll send a contemplative snapchat with huge blocks of text in which he muses over our \"\"relationship\"\" and how into me he is. I've played along because a) we really do seem to have a lot in common and b) I imagine I *would* like him if we knew each other in real life. \n\nBut the problem is that I don't feel anything for him. Answering his snaps often feels like a chore, even if we sometimes have good conversations. Part of it is because he's always asking me if I've lost interest in him yet, then apologizing for asking and informing me that he has low self-esteem and needs to make sure I'm still into him. And when my responses are curt, or when I leave him on read (which happens; I'm a busy guy lol), he gets really worried and asks urgently if I'm OK. \n\nHe's sweet. But he's also needy and annoying. However, what's most important is that I have no feelings for him. Part of me thinks I lack feelings for him because I haven't actually met him in person, so I can't conceptualize him as a real human being that I can have feelings for. Under that theory, I should try to meet with him (he's at home in TX this summer but goes to school in MA) before school starts. But because I don't like him (at least yet), I don't really feel a desire to meet him. He, like I said, is almost in love with me. He wrote a poem about me. \n\nAnother part of me is deathly worried that I may just be aromantic and thus incapable of romantic attraction. I've really only had like one or two crushes, and I sometimes don't really understand why/how people \"\"fall in love.\"\"\n\nThis was long and rambling, but the bottom line here is that I'd like some advice.\n","date":"Jul 1, 2019, 9:00 PM"},{"content":"7751 - Am I not allowed to add or drop classes until the fall?\n","date":"Jul 1, 2019, 9:00 PM"},{"content":"7750 - Sooo, if u premed and u don't make it...wyd\n","date":"Jul 1, 2019, 9:00 PM"},{"content":"7749 - When do people in summer assignment find out where they’re living?\n","date":"Jul 1, 2019, 9:00 PM"},{"content":"7748 - I dumped my boyfriend because he's a reactionary.\n","date":"Jul 1, 2019, 9:00 PM"},{"content":"7747 - topics: politics, stem/humanities spiciness\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI can’t wait until Trump wins again in 2020 so I can watch liberals complain more and make fools of themselves for another four years.

Short articles are fine, but I can't sit still for long enough to read more than 10 minutes in a row. I think I probably have some undiagnosed form of ADD. In high school, listening to my teachers for not more than 45 minutes each day was usually sufficient for me to learn the material, along with short homework assignments. But at Brown pretty much any social science or humanities class requires that you read on your own for several hours each week. I'm wondering how I can overcome this obstacle. Sometimes I cope but just not reading and instead trying to learn everything from lecture slides. This doesn't work unless the class is pretty easy though.

Interestingly, I’m more likely to give in to my urge to do this when I’m in a depressed or otherwise negative mood, whereas I’m able to resist it when life is going well.

They can't be for student housing or meal plan, since we pay for that separately. They can't be for facilities, since there's a $227.8 million \"\"Total General Operating Expenses & Subcontracts\"\" (I assume THIS is facilities, IT, etc.) section. Are they researchers? (Probably not, those are faculty).\n\nAt $21,705 per student (undergrad and grad) in staff expenses, I'm not really seeing a proportionate impact on my experience here. I thought universities should spend most of their money on faculty, equipment, and student support but I guess I'm wrong. At least fill some of these staffing positions with students - only $11.7 million was spent on student wages in FY19.\n\n$291.2 million went to \"\"Student Aid and Support\"\" of which $133 million is undergraduate financial aid. \"\"Graduate Student Aid and Support\"\" amounts to $145 million, or $64,600 for each graduate student (master's and doctoral). Master's students still pay tuition though, so where does this money go? I assume a PhD student doesn't need THAT much money. (The graduate student stipend was ~$24k in 2017).\n\nDoes anyone have a more detailed breakdown of the budget? It feels like our money is just going down a vacuum... I'd really like to know what exactly my tuition money is used for. Where can we get some transparency/accountability?\nBudget Link: https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/provost/sites/provost/files/FY20_URC_Approved_Feb92019.pdf\nUpdated Jun 30, 2019, 7:57 PM\n","date":"Jun 30, 2019, 7:57 PM"},{"content":"7731 - My mom for the first time directly confronted me about smoking weed and I told her that I didn’t.

He also lied about marching in the Civil Rights Movement during this campaign. Despite the lie he was still given a pass on his pro-segregation stance in the 70s; The topic didn't come up.\nHe withdrew before any caucuses / primaries.\n\n2008:\nSomehow his pro-segregation and anti-consumer policies never came up during his 2008 campaign but he did skip a couple of debates.\n\nWith his campaign theme \"\"Joe is right\"\" and racist comments like \"\"the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.\"\" (about Obama) ... he captured about 1% in the initial Iowa primary in 2008 and withdrew shortly thereafter.\n\nThe worst thing is that there are still people making excuses for him and calling honest, thoughtful criticism of him “divisive”.\n\nHow the fuck is the Democratic front runner spouting a “States Rights” argument on a debate stage in 2019?\n\nIs this how far we’ve sunk in the name of not being “divisive”, that we’re willing to brush off a candidate on the same stage as Bernie Sanders essentially arguing for separate but equal?\n\nHe was representing his state well, by the way, and he always did. I’ve lived in Delaware my whole life, and my father was born here, too. I don’t talk to him much anymore but I’m still haunted by some of the stories he told, like how the Brookside community association closed down their pool and community clubhouse because a judge forced them to admit black residents, or how he and his friends would call each other and throw rocks at black people trying to walk to work near his neighborhood, or how his high school banned students from spectating at home basketball games against Wilmington high school team after a near race riot.\n\nDelaware, I should remind you, was one of the handful of states that, owing to never having seceded, had slavery after the Emancipation Proclamation, right up until the 13th was passed. Everyone here likes to pretend we’re just a generic Blue State, since we have a Democratic trifecta and haven’t had a Republican governor since 1993, but there’s still a lot of systemic racism and police brutality here. We’re just lucky to walk between the raindrops. Once in a while you’ll get a think piece about all the corporation with shoebox sized “headquarters” here for tax purposes or the murder rate in Wilmington, but most of the time it’s just lol screen door factory.\n\nJoe Biden is kind of an embodiment of that, going to school at the fancy schmancy private Archmere Academy. Archmere is right on the edge of the city and the area highlights how this state has grinding poverty and social decay right next to million dollar houses for capitalists.\n\nIf you drive south of Newark and stop anywhere between there and Rehoboth Beach, it feels like 1979, not 2019. I remember the strife at the central Delaware school where I first worked when the number of black students started going up.\n\nHell, there are still restaurants around here that quietly deny black patrons service with slow seating and discourage them with bad seating and poor service. I vividly remember about ten years ago stopping in a Waffle House outside Middletown and watching every patron stop what they were doing and start staring and muttering at an interracial couple.\n\nYeah, Joe Biden was serving his constituents, just like he was serving his constituents by making it harder for the likes of us to settle debt should we have a crisis or supporting the pharmaceutical industry or loosening banking regulations.\n\nThe idea that people are handling this grinning frat boy idiot like he’s somehow accomplished utterly baffles me. Can no one else see what he is? You know why he didn’t change his stance on the Hyde Amendment until this month? Why he didn’t offer his limp, dissembling apology to Anita Hill until now? Because he doesn’t care.\n\nBiden isn’t up on that stage for a cause. He’s up there because he wants to be President for its own sake. Bernie has his social and economic reforms, Warren her economic ideals, Pete has Democratic reform. Hell, even the nutty crystal lady isn’t up there for herself.\n\nThe worst thing in all of this are all the Biden supporters telling us to calm down and chill out like it’s a certainty that he, and not the other 23 candidates, will get the nod. Like we have to stay quiet and that will, somehow, stop the insidious Russo-Republican reactionary axis from jumping on Biden’s liabilities and blasting them to the heavens.\n\nThe narrative that we who criticize him now, in the primary, are at fault for Russian propaganda is already being built and spread.\n\nHere’s the deal: if the Democratic Party embraces Joe Biden -even if that embrace is a cautious, anxious side hug to keep junk from junk- then the Democrats will have rejected the idea of the first black president as soundly as Republican racist lunatics have.\n\nObama may not have been the messianic figure from his campaign poster, but the election of a black man to the big chair drove this country a little insane. When the Republicans ran screaming from this moment of equality, it seemed elements within the Democratic Party and the electorate decided to run after them, and maybe see if they can find a middle ground of genteel white tennis club racism to adopt.\n\nJoe Biden is the living actualization of what MLK called the White Moderate:\n\n“I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to \"\"order\"\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: \"\"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\"\"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a \"\"more convenient season.\"\" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.”\nhttps://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html\n","date":"Jun 30, 2019, 1:58 PM"},{"content":"7726 - Question for people who use reuseable contacts from someone who’s wearing contacts for the first time: how do you ensure you’re being hygienic when you’re cleaning them considering dorm bathrooms are pretty dirty?\n","date":"Jun 30, 2019, 1:58 PM"},{"content":"7725 - Best places to get a tattoo in prov?\n","date":"Jun 30, 2019, 1:20 PM"},{"content":"7724 - Can CLPS concentrators do the 5th year master in public health?\n","date":"Jun 30, 2019, 1:20 PM"},{"content":"\"7723 - Hey all, \nI’m a filmmaker and I recently ran into the storyboard and almost complete pre-production planning work for a stop motion film I wanted to make three years ago.

All of us should be vigilant and careful to characterize each candidates’ problems in an appropriate light - these articles often blow “problems” with these candidates out of proportion to get increased attention. Every candidate has their own set of problems, but let us not repeat the 2016 shitshow where we fuck over our own candidate by spreading libel\"\"\n\nY'all, I am not saying to NOT criticize candidates, but that we should be criticizing them APPROPRIATELY. I am saying that some sources of news blow things out of proportion and make it sound much worse than it is. \n\nFrom this article:\nhttps://medium.com/@westonpagano/a-guide-to-the-2020-democratic-candidates-you-should-not-vote-for-c1c6e4c9c26 - just as an EXAMPLE, under Pete Buttigieg, it says \"\"Opposes tuition free public college\"\" - okay, but that is not the whole story at all, as he said last night. He thinks public college should be free for everyone except the richest among us because they can evidently pay! You may not agree with that, but that is not the same thing as completely opposing tuition free public college. As more than one of you in the comments said, you did not read every single article connected to this more broad article to fact check, and if you just went off the headline, you WOULD GET THE WRONG IDEA. \n\nAnother one from Mayor Pete - opposes universal childcare. Click the article - it links you to a fucking tweet - for god's sake - from Zephyr Teachout, a random person who says she likes Elizabeth Warren's plan for universal childcare more than Buttigieg's plan for a tax credit allowance for childcare. But hearing that Buttigieg opposes universal childcare would lead the average person to believe he does not have a plan regarding childcare and that he does not care about how American families can take care of their children.\n\nThat is why I am saying to be more mindful of sharing things that are not misleading. I don't even like Mayor Pete - I personally am interested in Warren - but in less than 10 minutes, and just with reviewing the materials literally linked to, you can see that these criticisms are framed in a biased light. In a day and age where people will make all their judgements based on a headline, you should all hold yourselves as to a higher standard and make sure you accurately represent the views these politicians hold.\nUpdated Jun 30, 2019, 1:19 PM\n","date":"Jun 30, 2019, 1:19 PM"},{"content":"7702 - can anybody say a few things about korean 100, is the professor good and how's the class overall?\n","date":"Jun 30, 2019, 1:18 PM"},{"content":"7701 - The world would be a better place if everyone was a little bit gayer\n","date":"Jun 30, 2019, 1:18 PM"},{"content":"7700 - What if we flooded the cit so cs people had to take baths\n","date":"Jun 30, 2019, 1:18 PM"},{"content":"7699 - Can the Summer@Brown RAs please let their kids know that Nelson etiquette involves NOT entering closed bathroom doors bc they don’t lock.

Biden represents the normalcy of the Obama era, when the Presidency was respected and handled with professionalism and dignity. Compared to Trump, Biden is a decent man who means well and isn't blatantly hateful or insane. The idea of Biden replacing Trump was a very comforting thought in the midst of the Trump administration. But now we have many candidates to choose from, and compared to these other candidates, Biden isn't special anymore. Is he a bad person? I would say no. Nothing that he has done comes close to the morally reprehensible things that Trump has done. But Biden is far from perfect, and he is no longer that symbol of the benevolent President we've all been longing for.

The classic example is a white dude sharing a quote from a black person stating some view of race that is almost entirely held by white people.

This is a valid argument. As a Jew myself, I think there are certainly comparisons to be made, and non-Jews are totally welcome to share that belief. But don’t use some random person’s status as a Jew to enhance your own argument. If you want to explain how the mass genocide of the Holocaust was preceded by lesser acts of violence and detention, go right ahead. You don’t have to be Jewish to say that. But when you share a random Jewish woman’s tweet, you’re implying that this woman speaks on behalf of all Jews, and that Jews shouldn’t hold other viewpoints because “hey, this Jew agrees with me so why don’t you?”\n\nThis is a lesson that can certainly apply across the board to many identities and many contexts.

There can be a fundamentally blurrier line between work and play/leisure in the humanities than STEM that I think people outside it don't realize. On the one hand you can use everything when you're studying and writing about media, and you get to do fun things for classes, like watch movies and read Jane Austen, but conversely you have to pay attention to everything. I simply don't think you can do will in the humanities, whether by intrinsic or extrinsic standards if you don't think hard about a lot of things, and this includes the trope experience of going to see the latest Avengers but then thinking the whole time about how its capitalist and American constraints shape everything it says to a global audience about race gender and power, but also in your \"\"free time\"\" do academically implicated things like go to art openings, read newspapers, do activism or politics, read experimental novels, have late night philosophical conversations, aggressively pursue certain cultural literacies (which one may gloss without too much loss as \"\"learning to sound smart\"\"), etc. etc. etc.: this is true too with STEM and hobby projects / extracurriculars, but there still more of a line - even technical STEM knowledge comes up regularly in weird forms in humanities discussions. As a math / literary arts double concentrator, I find doing good work in the humanities must harder in the ways I care about than graduate level pure math, just, as 10000 stemlords have recently point out, easier in the ways I don't care about. It's easy to get As in the humanities! Unfortunately, you don't get very much forgetting As in humanities! Not job security, not necessarily grad school, possibly a latin word or two, but also probably not a sense of wisdom and personal fulfillment. On the other hand, it's effectively impossible to write prose that I'm satisfied with, that's structurally / theoretically interesting, that the teacher likes, that plays well in workshop, etc; I haven't found critical writing any \"\"easier\"\" - or ever felt like I've definitively \"\"understood\"\" a reading in the way there's a point at which I've sufficiently understood a theorem - even when criticism/theory's great and clearly written: it unfolds. The point that keeps getting made is a variation on \"\"you may not have to struggle intensely against external standards of evaluation to get a humanities degree, whereas you will almost certainly struggle for many hours to get a STEM degree.\"\" That's a true but not a very interesting point - actually, challenging positivist attempts to measure quality, and the forms of economic cultural and political power that give a BROWN CS degree say, in itself, a certain kind of access and power. There, see, and the point can be made without even quote Derrida once: but if you wanted to, you might make the point by trying to ask what the gesture of the \"\"Dear Blueno\"\" letter does, how the act of writing to be anonymous makes a claim to \"\"presence\"\" - without the deceptions of repressions of name and social consequence - but perhaps then argue that it is in fact, for exactly that reason, the most performative \"\"clothed\"\" and calculated gesture of self-aggrandizement of all, indeed the place where identity (name) is spoken!\n","date":"Jun 26, 2019, 12:45 AM"},{"content":"7627 - Question: What does sexual attraction feel like? \n\nTL;DR: \nI wanted to ask what sexual attraction/desire actually feel like because I haven't found any resources describing it online and I feel like I experience at least some of aspects of demisexuality or asexuality but always find myself questioning whether or not I do or do not or have ever actually experienced sexual attraction\n\nContext: \nI'm starting to feel like I might've been confusing a want for close physical contact (cuddling, holding hands, all that jazz) with sexual desire because I never distinctly feel a want to have sex. \n\nI've had sex a fair few number of times (only with other men) and I enjoy it enough but I wonder if that's mostly because of the physical aspects of it.\n\nMaybe a bit TMI...

Doing just 'well' in STEM gradewise takes more effort--but not necessarily more smarts. All that said, Brown as a school is much stronger in the humanities than in STEM. You are not at MIT or even CMU. The average 'stand out' humanities student here is smarter than the average high achieving STEM student. You may be getting the best humanities students here, but you're almost certainly not getting the best STEM students. Yes, a lot of people at brown were 'good' at everything in highschool, but you're getting more cream of the crop on the humanities side by virtue of Brown's niche. A lot of humanities kids here also took a full calculus sequence and sometimes Lin alg and diff eqs in highschool (for people who didn't have that opportunity, skip this point)--that math is the same math no matter where you go. Most STEM outside of math here does not need much more than that. You're kidding yourself if you think your ability to bullshit a high school 5 pager book report is the same as writing a coherent and convincing high-level 25 page paper in college. Many STEM people could bullshit through a 15 pager and do fine gradewise, but do you have it in you to write something worthy of scholarly conversation? Most humanities kids here do. A lot of STEM people do not, even though they love to assume they have a great sense of logic; the reality is, once you take away structure and clear goals, a lot of the people who are STEM elitists crumble. Ask yourself: was I taking advantage of the fact there were no set in stone answers when I did well on that paper? Did I actually add anything of worth? Because if the answers are no, you aren't good at humanities, you know how to get a grade, and equate that with being smart.\n","date":"Jun 26, 2019, 12:45 AM"},{"content":"7624 - topics: stem/humanities spiciness\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nObvious CW for stem-humanities thing\n\nY'all on about this stem-humanities debate are some petty ass motherfuckers.

I would like to educate and to learn more from personal experiences regarding this topic.\n\nMy question: to the person who said they identify as transracial, is there anything you'd be willing to share about your experience/ feelings?\n\nI am curious because I personally have problems with identifying as African American if you are not ethnically African American due to the history and oppression behind being black in America (ie ancestors being slaves, being discriminated against socially and systemically bc of skin color since birth) that someone not born African American cannot claim. It is less about African American society/culture and more about how African Americans have to navigate a country that is so against them exclusively because of their biology.\n\nAnd a comparison often made is transgender. But race is different from gender identity because gender can be hard-wired into our brains independent of society, and sometimes the hard-wiring is not consistent with the bodies we're born into. But race is determined by the experiences of our ancestors and how we are viewed in this world, which shape our brains strictly after birth.\n\nSo I am very curious why you identify as African American, because I'm wondering if it it might actually mean something else (not to dismiss how you feel); no amount of feeling belonging to a culture and people can change your ancestors' experiences and how you have always been perceived by the world. The things you are feeling are complex and no one can understand/explain them except for you, which is why I am asking about your experience.

Philosophy had more support from the professor, but if you weren’t good at budgeting your time, you could spend a day trying to decipher a sentence. \n\nI’ve also taken an “easy” math class, and an “easy” poetry class. Everyone in the poetry class got an A as far as I know, but I think what people misunderstand about arts classes is that it may be easy to get a good grade, but to actually improve your poetry, it takes a lot of out of class time and effort. Not everyone in the math class got an A, but it seemed like most people improved just during class time. \n\nSTEM people, your careers are taken more seriously by the world, your subjects are increasingly better funded, and you will probably make more money than me. Humanities people, though it definitely varies by field, the amount of agency we’re given over your education sometimes means that we get to choose how hard we want to work, with less of an impact on grades, but even for the majority of us who are working really hard to improve and learn, we will not have the same job security or be taken as seriously as STEM concentrators are. \n\nBoth fields are hard for different reasons.

People bond over it, saying things like \"\"oh yeah I hate math, I suck at it haha\"\". You do kind of look like a fool for saying \"\"oh I suck at reading haha\"\". I think the reason for this is that most people can go through their lives without needing to use any math beyond basic arithmetic and algebra. That being said, having an appreciation for higher math and science (in my experience), adds a layer of depth and color to your analysis of real world events, statistics presented in the news, and the world around you. This is similar to the way that knowledge of classic literature and music might enrich your experiences in the world around you. Basically, the reason why STEM people tend to have a little bit of a superiority complex is because it is often seen as normal be \"\"bad\"\" at STEM. They have been socialized as the people that persevered when others just accepted that they don't have a knack for STEM. In reality, different subjects come easier to different people, and it's silly to say that STEM is inherently harder than humanities. I'm sure there are some more objective differences if you want to go fishing through data, like grade inflation being higher in one area than the other.

They might be kicked off, they might get off with probation, or they might walk away clean. No one knows.\n\nAs for people in Sigma denying these rumors, yea, no shit they're gonna deny it. Firstly, most people don't want their friends knowing they hazed a kid to the point of hospitalization. Secondly, they're trying really hard to not go down for this. I have 5 close friends in Sigma. 4/5 completely denied all of it, even though I know someone else close to what happened who told me the whole story (and who I trust). 1/5 admitted they were in deep shit but wouldn't give any more detail.

If you did, you might notice that there are hundreds of people, drinking free alcohol, and that it's a great way for your average Brown student to unwind. With the exceptions of sports teams (which have plenty of their own problems, and I would argue are worse than frats), there are no other groups that regularly throw large parties that are open to the broader community. \n\nI am a rising senior that is not in greek life, but have a lot of friends who are. On the average Saturday night, it's pretty common for me to end up at a frat party. Sure, those small parties for a friends birthday or whatever are a ton of fun, but not all of us get invited to a ton of small parties all the time. If I just want to go somewhere to drink, unwind, and meet some new people as an upperclassmen, a frat party is really the only way to do it.\n\nDo some frats on campus have issues? Absolutely, but that doesn't mean we should destroy greek life because of it.\n\nLet's think back to spring weekend. The school cracked down on drinking on campus, so there were 4 different huge off-campus darties that different frats were hosting. I actually wandered into all four and saw well over 1,500 kids across these 4 darties- where would 1000 different students party without frats? Do you want to open up your house to hundreds of random people, spend thousands of dollars on alcohol, and risk legal repercussions? If so, just send me an invite and I'm there, and then we can talk about disbanding frats.

I can understand the religious argument but I don’t know how to feel about the idea of religious tradition being prioritized over bodily autonomy (the autonomy of a newborn is definitely debatable, but I think it’s good to consider how the choices a parent makes for their child will affect them when they’re an adult), especially given that circumcision is an irreversible procedure that someone can pursue later in their life. \n\nIf you’re a cis man who is happy with your circumcised penis, great! If it’s an important symbol of your religious or cultural identity, that’s awesome, but I think it’s important to think about the way this conversation affects marginalized people, like transfeminine folks, for whom circumcision may not only be challenging aesthetically or in terms of their relationship with religion/their background, but also in terms of their functional, physical existence and health. I’m not religious and that limits my perspective, but I am transfeminine and I think it’s important to include people like me in these conversations. \n\nI also get that some people may be tired of hearing about circumcision debates, but commenting stuff like “men pls stop arguing about your dicks” can be exclusive to trans people and invalidate the bodily autonomy/experiences of people with dicks. Please call me out if anything I’ve said feels reductive or antisemitic or otherwise dumb 😎\n","date":"Jun 15, 2019, 10:27 AM"},{"content":"7370 - Ik it depends by year, but in general, how likely is it for a group of three or four to get placed together in mid-year assignment for the spring?

Obviously, seeing that somebody did better than you is always tough, and I can see how having your own experience and struggle can make it frustrating to see someone with more successful grades wondering about their chances for med school/a job/etc. \n\nHowever, I think sometimes when we’re caught up in wanting no experience to be invalidated, we forget about the importance of not comparing ourselves to others. Of course there will always be people who do better, and of course every person has their own insecurities. Until we see posts directly attacking people with lower gpas, the perceived “humblebrag” is just a manifestation of our insecurities. It’s not worth being upset over— again, there will always be people who do better than you at anything, and always people who have an easier time.

Don't get me wrong, it's true that these individuals are hard working and generally law abiding people, but it's also equally true that they are not supposed to be here. As the richest country in the world, I understand and support the necessity for the U.S to safeguard its border and economy by maintaining a strong immigration system, we should not let illegal aliens make a mockery of our national security by giving them the illusion that they can just trespass into U.S territory, violate our sovereignty and simply be allowed to stay. If they want to be an American so badly, they should start abiding American laws like the rest of us legal immigrants who worked so hard to get here. \n\nBut since it's both illegal and immoral to round up all 11 million aliens and deport them, I'm all for a citizenship pathway for those who are highly skilled, hard-working, and ready to integrate themselves into the American culture we all know and love, like what I went through.\n","date":"Jun 9, 2019, 8:53 PM"},{"content":"7247 - I've been waiting quite a while for someone to make a scientific argument for climate change and I have not yet seen any compelling arguments, so I would like to introduce my viewpoint into the public discourse.

The fact you think black people can’t be racist because they’re “prejudiced” or “bigoted” instead is the most semantic argument I’ve ever heard. Just going to weigh in with my own experience... I’ll admit I grew up in a very liberal city so take it with a grain of salt, but I have almost never seen a white person express any dislike for another person because of their skin color. When I have seen it, they were condemned by almost everyone around them and were shamed for having such an abhorrent opinion. On the other hand I’ve seen black people be openly racist towards Asians, Indians, whites, etc - legitimately for no reason other than their skin color. You can say I’m lying or whatever but that’s 100% the truth. Most people who witnessed it felt too uncomfortable to condemn it because they were too worried about racial politics but it’s ridiculous that being racist is okay if you’re black or another minority. Just to clarify, I am not saying at all that all black people are racist or that all white people aren’t - very obviously not the case!! - I’m saying that if you consider yourself to be an upstanding member or society you should condemn racism in all forms and not dismiss it as “just prejudice” or whatever.\n","date":"Jun 8, 2019, 4:23 PM"},{"content":"\"7206 - cw:business sneks\n\nSilicon Valley > Wallstreet\nChange my mind\"\n","date":"Jun 8, 2019, 4:23 PM"},{"content":"7205 - Is caps open/still free over the summer?\n","date":"Jun 8, 2019, 4:22 PM"},{"content":"7204 - Has anyone been forced to take a leave due to being on suspension level?

But it still reflects an instance of race being used as a reason to hate someone. I would argue that “reverse-racism” is an apt label for this type of unjustified hatred. And this isn’t just something that happens on an individual basis. I would argue that racial hatred aimed at individual members of historically privileged racial groups is something that happens pretty frequently, as an understandable but unfair reaction to racism itself. This reverse-racism isn’t something white people should complain about as if it’s at all similar to true racism. However, reverse-racism is still a problematic method of fighting racism, in that it unfairly targets individuals and stems from an urge to hate people on the basis of race.\n","date":"Jun 6, 2019, 12:55 PM"},{"content":"7193 - If you receive a message from someone you haven’t talked to in a while shooting their shot, how would you feel?\n","date":"Jun 6, 2019, 12:55 PM"},{"content":"7192 - How does one go about applying to be a TA for PLCY 100?\n","date":"Jun 6, 2019, 12:55 PM"},{"content":"7191 - to Catholics at Brown: I know many of you are not homophobic.

All who I know had more A's than I did.\n\nThird, I dropped a class freshman year, and still received Magna. One of the deans told me the dropped class would essentially count as a B. However, as Magna is based on enrollment units, by taking a different summer course at Brown and getting an A, I basically replaced that drop with an extra A. In other words, I had 3 B's/S's AND a drop and still received the award.\n\nFinally, please, please don't stress about this, as simplistic as that sounds. Being concerned about grades and academics is extremely valid. However, what really matters, at least in my opinion (which us by no means everyone's), is the larger Brown experience--the people you meet, the professors you connect with, the meaningful coursework and projects you complete, etc. Don't let one silly honors take away from all you have accomplished, both on and off your transcript.\n","date":"May 30, 2019, 2:50 PM"},{"content":"7007 - I'm a sophomore trying to register absentee for my state elections in 2019 anyway urgent question: do we keep the same mail number???\n","date":"May 30, 2019, 2:50 PM"},{"content":"\"7006 - anyone want to talk about their experiences in econ 1750: investments ii?\n\"\n","date":"May 30, 2019, 2:50 PM"},{"content":"7005 - cw: the same people commenting\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAm I the only one who thinks there should be a limit to how often people can comment on dear bluneo?

(Green light for people trying to start something similar - be warned, it's extremely difficult.) For resources at Brown I would definitely recommend SHAG. Another great resource for beginners is r/BDSMcommunity on reddit. The Center for Sexual Pleasure and Health, a local organization in RI, is also great. They have sex therapists and a ton of other resources.\n\nThe rest of this is personal experience and POV, so take it with a grain of salt!!! Sorry if it's rambly.\n\nI don't hold your same identities, but I'd definitely say that people who aren't cis men should be extra careful and cautious when venturing into most BDSM spaces, unfortunately, although exceptions exist and are becoming more common. Red flags include: people who act like they own you or order you around before even meeting; people who won't meet in public; people who refuse to use safewords or negotiate; people who say they have no limits; people who don't ask for or respect consent; people with a strict definition of what a \"\"true\"\" submissive/slave/master/whatever is; etc. Trust your gut and don't go if something seems off. \n\nFetLife is out there, but it leans strongly heterosexual, and it's not super intuitive. If you go to events, do your research about who's running them and if they are generally trusted among the community. Always tell someone where you'll be and to assume an emergency if they haven't heard from you by a predetermined time (AKA a safe call). Don't expect to find the perfect partner quickly. Once you weed out the red flags, the kink community is perhaps the best at communication around consent and pleasure. \n\nIf you're a bi girl, I would expect that you'd have the best time with a kinky queer play partner, but they will be harder to find (not to discount straight men completely haha). For gay/bi guys reading this, there's an app/site called Recon that is something like a cross between scruff and fetlife. Again, you'll have to do a lot of weeding before finding good trustworthy play partners. \n\nPriorities should always include: communication, trust, risk-awareness, safety, and after-care. Empty your mind of anything related to \"\"50 shades\"\" except that it's a horrible representation of how kink should be in the real world. \"\n","date":"May 29, 2019, 2:16 PM"},{"content":"6966 - How the fuck do i cancel tinder gold\n","date":"May 29, 2019, 2:16 PM"},{"content":"6965 - I got straight Bs in all my classes as a freshman.

Hot. And humid, as Providence summers were wont to be. The August sun beamed down on her, pleasant enough in its pre-noontime equanimity. All that June and July, she had worked and wallowed in equal measure, falling into the latter after failing to sufficiently engross herself in the former. Perhaps, she decided, it would be better to be generous and call it self-reflection. Self-reflection or not, No-rae wanted to change. Her first year had been tough. Spoiled by a close-knit friend group that had defined her high school years, she had expected to make friends quickly and easily. And she had, to a certain extent. But in her need to create a place for herself, she had tried so hard to fit in—to make other people like her, that at some point, she had lost her sense of self. College was supposed to be that place where you found yourself, where you met the people you would be friends, or even lovers, with for the rest of your life. And instead, she found herself stuck as everyone’s second choice, with no one that she could really call a friend. She had people who she could wave to in the street, who she could make the pretense of catching up with, who she could exchange pleasantries with—but she had never felt more alone. No-rae had expected the summer to be a welcome reprieve, a time for her to catch up with her old friends—but hearing their litany of stories about new crushes and new friends, all unfamiliar to her--she felt the dread of isolation chaining her to the preceding year. \nAnd so, she wanted to change. She needed to. \nThe hammock had seemed like a reasonable purchase at the time—what better way to change than to emulate the effortless nonchalance of the undeniably relaxed people who hung hammocks on the green? But underneath the sun, now beating down on her increasing intensity, No-rae realized that ‘effortless’ was anything but. As she fumbled with knots, she became conscious of how she must look to the people passing by. Something dry and papery rose in the back of her throat, and she hated herself for it—why was she even getting upset over something so small? \n“Looks like you’re having a bit of trouble. Want some help?”\nAnd that was how she first met Luce.\nHer name was Luce, short for Lucerna. She was a second-year transfer student, on campus early for BOLT. Bright, cheery, and interesting, she was the picture of someone comfortable in her own skin. She ooh’ed when she learned that No-rae was on campus for RPL training, keeping up a steady stream of cheerful questions as she taught No-rae how to properly hang the hammock. Satisfied that No-rae was now equipped to face the challenge of lying in the shade by herself, Luce flashed her a brilliant smile and a “catch you later”. And with that, she was gone.\n+++\nNo-rae glared at the screen, fully aware that agonizing over sending a Facebook message was completely unproductive. Even as she rationalized it as a simple (meaningless, really!) gesture between friends—or maybe acquaintances was more accurate—she still worried over what conclusions Luce might draw from the simple message. After silently arguing with herself for well over an hour, she managed to rally herself and push aside her doubts for long enough to send Luce an invite to the lecture board event, along with an accompanying message. \n\nOver the next couple of hours, No-rae compulsively checked her phone in hopes of receiving some validation that her inoffensive one-line greeting hadn’t somehow given Luce the wrong impression. At last, she received a response—“Sure! Gina Rodriguez from Jane the Virgin right? Sounds super interesting!”\n\n+\n\nThey met outside the lecture, both marveling at the lengthy queue that sprawled down from the gymnasium to block off the rest of the sidewalk. Settling comfortably in the middle of the line, they began to talk. After exchanging the usual questions of hopes and dreams reduced to pleasantries—“What do you want to study?”, “What do you want to do?”, they began to share details about their lives.\n\nLuce had a father—an artist, and a brother, who was working somewhere in the Middle East. She loved flowers, especially irises, and liked pineapple on pizza. Born and raised in New York, she was a connoisseur of both pizzas and bagels, and was more than happy to speak at length on either topic. She was also an attentive listener, carefully responding to what No-rae had to say as well. \n\nNo-rae felt as if the end of their hour-long queue had come too soon. Captivated by what they had shared, she wished that they could speak for even longer. As the room swelled with people and the lecture began, No-rae found herself distracted from the talk, stealing glances out of the corner of her eye at Luce to see how she should react, even as she mentally chastised herself for doing so. But then, when the corners of Luce’s crinkled up in laughter, when she had turned to No-rae, whispering a joke in her ear, No-rae felt for the first time since coming to Brown that she had really found a friend.\n\n+++\n\nThey grew close, bonding over late nights in the Scili, excursions to the different coffee shops around campus, and cracking jokes at the expense of their least favorite professors. The time they spent together was ordinary, filled with conversations about their everyday lives--though they didn’t do anything special, no grand gestures, that alone was enough to make everyday feel special. \n\nEvery moment was precious and dear, and as they grew to be able to rely on each other, No-rae thought that maybe, just maybe, she herself was important too. And as they shared these moments together, uncertain, awkward, hopeful feelings began to sprout between them. \n\n+++\n\nOne night, riding a wave of nostalgia after another late-night study session, they had been struck by a sudden inspiration after passing by a playground. Even through the haziness of the late night and the street lamps’ halogen glow, Luce made swinging on the swings seem like a good idea. The nighttime chill frosted their laughter, condensing their feelings into clouds of steamy breath. Luce, not content to swing on her own, reached a hand out to grab No-rae’s hand, sending them both twisting around in circles. And then No-rae knew that she had to ask.\n\nGlad that the arrangement of the swings meant that Luce couldn’t see her face, No-rae paused.\n“Hey Luce…”\n“Want to go on a date sometime?”\n\nAnd then, she felt Luce squeeze her hand in response, and whether it was the sleep-deprivation, or the cold, or the spinning, she felt like the world looked different. \n\n+++\n\nTheir dates were also normal, just ordinary outings and time spent together, but that time became all the more special for it. And throughout all that time, as she tentatively navigated the feelings and responsibility that came with her relationship, she cherished the time that they spent together.\nLove was a strange feeling, but all she knew was that she wanted to be with Luce for a long, long, time. \n+++\nThe night simmered with the unique unease of an almost realized dream, an unease marked by a clenched stomach, bracing for the possibility of not putting on a good showing, for the ‘I’m sorry”—for the fear of disappointing, or worse, hurting Luce. It was an unease born of wanting—of letting herself want—an unfamiliar emotion, so incongruous with the pitted cinderblock of the walls. She swallowed it, willing herself to ignore the uncertainty that clawed—after all, wasn’t she allowed to want this?\nLuce, when she saw her, was beautiful. An understatement. And then everything was normal, normal conversation, normal feelings, as if nothing was different—but everything was different, and there was a constant undercurrent of fear and anticipation. There should have been nothing to be afraid of—she and Luce had spoken on the subject before, had confirmed, in more or less words, that this was something they wanted. And it was. But. \nAnd then, when there was a lull in the conversation, when the weight of a familiar hand settled on her shoulder, she felt her stomach tighten in anticipation. The hand reached up, brushing No-rae’s hair back behind her ear. Hyper-aware, she noticed Luce starting to lean towards her. This was it. This was what she was waiting for. She closed her eyes, pursing her lips in anticipation of a kiss. But it didn’t come. \nA heartbeat. Two heartbeats. She cracked an eye open.\n“Oh…?” Luce grinned. “Glad to see that you’re enthusiastic!” \nCheeks, red with blushing embarrassment. Tinkling laughter, undammed, painted the room with warmth. And then, together, a conflux of laughter, sweeping up her fear and sending it bursting forth into the air, recast into relief. And then that relief was swept away, transforming into something urgent, something needy, jostling and pushing until a wall inside her was broken. And then there was nothing left to hold it back, the scalding current pouring into her body and lighting her ablaze. \nStill giggling, Luce began to mouth a question—but before the words left her mouth, No-rae was already pressing her body into Luce’s and reaching an arm up to pull Luce’s head down towards her, meeting Luce halfway with her own lips. She pulled, hard, and then their lips met, and teeth clicked together, pain—but barely registered, the hot saltiness of blood only adding to the current of desire that was swallowing her whole. An embrace of lips, of tongues intertwining and exploring the ridges of unfamiliar teeth, though greeted as a reunion of old friends. And then there was the flavor of orange tic-tacs and Crest toothpaste, registering on her tongue as the flavor of Luce, so impossibly sweet. And then they broke apart, gasping for breath, before desperately locking their lips together again, as if each second spent drawing in oxygen was only a distraction from what they needed. \nAnd then they were on the bed, and then on top of each other, bodies flush with sweat and desire, pressing together with such intensity that it must have seemed they wanted to become one. And then, fingers, fumbling to unhook a bra from an unfamiliar direction, fingers, teasing an electric current over bare skin, fingers, digging into their partner’s back as the body attached to them shuddered in ecstasy. And then their bodies separated, briefly, before diving back together. An agony of arched backs and writhing hips, beating a tattoo on the cheap dorm mattress as the two violently painted a canvas of desire, of bitemarks and scratches, on each other’s flushed skin. \n++\nThe door creaked open, spilling light into the room and silhouetting Luce’s body through her clothes. Closing the door behind her, Luce clambered onto the bed. Air-cold limbs slid underneath the sheets, colliding with warm skin to the tune of half-hearted protests, before nestling comfortably against No-rae’s body. Blushing furiously in the dark, No-rae mustered up her courage to ask: “So what did you think?”\nLuce’s tinkling laughter, again. “Hmmm. I think you need some more practice.” \nThe laughter was cut short by a quick gasp as a hand slid beneath her clothes. \n“Yes, lots.”\n+\nComfortable silence buoying them in the darkness, their hands found each other and then, silently, clasped together. \n“I love you.”\n“I love you.”\n+++\nThe next two years flew by. They grew, together, making a space for themselves on campus. As they struggled to navigate the pressures of finding friends, classwork, and extracurriculars, the mutual support that they offered each other stayed constant. \n+++\nBut, by senior year, the old pleasantries of “How are your classes?” and “How was the recent break?” found the almost accusatory question of “So what are you plans after graduating?” added to their ranks. No-rae had played along with the change, gamely joking about the difficulty of finding a job, but Luce had gently evaded the question every time it was brought up.\nAll spring, she had pretended without knowing why. Without knowing if her pretending would help Luce at all, if that paper-thin barrier that they had put up in front of that unspoken topic of the future would prevent it from coming. And yet, she pretended, because she trusted Luce, because she would do anything to keep her safe, to batten down the hatches of the present in defiance of uncertainty.\nAnd yet, she knew that she would have to ask. Was going to ask—if not now, then later—but why later, if now was better?\nShe and Luce had always emphasized communication, had shared their deepest fears, and hopes, and even more importantly, the trivialities as well—their annoyances and fleeting thoughts, revealed to each other. They had always kept each other in the loop. And yet, Luce had chosen not to speak about it, had charmingly disarmed inquiries about post-graduation plans with smiles and questions. But No-rae knew Luce well enough to know that there was something else beneath that veneer of friendliness, something more than just nervousness or uncertainty. \nSo. She asked. About ‘after’. \nLuce paused for a moment, plucking at the loose threads at the hem of her sweatshirt. \n“No-rae. I think that we should break up.”\nNo-rae felt as if she had swallowed something hot and sharp.\n“Why?”\n“I’m not going to be graduating, and I don’t want to hold you back.”\nHow could she not be graduating? No-rae was almost certain that Luce had more than enough credits to graduate. Regardless, it wasn’t like she would be fine with leaving Luce for a reason like that. She took Luce’s hand into her own.\n\n“It doesn’t matter if you’re graduating or not. I’ll wait for you! We’re a team—don’t say something like you’re holding me back.”\nLuce was crying now, really crying. Tears were dripping down from her cheeks onto their clasped hands. \n“You don’t get it. I’m not going to be able to graduate. Not now, and not ever.”\n“It doesn’t matter if you don’t graduate. If you want to do something else—who needs a degree anyway? I’m going to be here for you. We can make this work.” \nDesperate to believe what she was saying, she repeated it again: “We can make this work.”\nLuce kept sobbing. “You don’t get it. I can’t be like you. I don’t have an ‘after’.”\nNo-rae couldn’t stop herself from asking again. “Why?”\nIn response, Luce sat there, just crying. Finally, she half laughed, half cried, “I’m Blueno.”\nNo-rae managed to choke out a laugh. “What? I’m being serious.”\n“That’s what you don’t get. I am being serious. I’m Blueno.”\nNo-rae didn’t know what to say. She didn’t believe it, not when Luce insisted that she was telling the truth. Not when they walked over to Simmons Quad. Not when they stood in front of Blueno. Only when Luce closed her eyes and Blueno’s lamp swelled with light, bright enough to blind her even through squinted eyes. Only then, did she believe it. And even then, she still clung to desperate hope, that it could still work out. \nBut, Luce shook her head, tears streaming down her face again. “I wish. I wish, more than anything, that just you staying would be enough. But it isn’t. It can’t work like that. Once you graduate, I won’t be your Luce anymore.”\nAnd then No-rae knew that it was really over, that the end had really come, and the tears, hot and wet, spilled out of her. But she knew, that it must hurt even more for Luce, and then she reached for Luce, pulling her into a hug. And they stood there, underneath Blueno’s lamp, holding each other, listening to each others’ heartbeats. \nAnd then, No-rae put her hands on Luce’s shoulders. Even though she was still crying, she said it fiercely. “I’m not going to abandon you. If this is really the end, then we’re going to make these last couple of weeks really count.”\n+++\nThey were inseparable for the last few weeks of school. They visited all their old haunts, recalling fond memories of studying together for Andrews, back when they had lived up in Pembroke. They went to the GCB, ordering the same set of lemon drop shots that had wiped out No-rae on her first trip to the GCB on her 21st birthday. They ate muffins at Blue Room, climbed the roof of Metcalf, and made funny faces at each other in the AQR. They did everything that they had put off before, climbing the Seekonk Bridge and exploring the abandoned train tunnel. \nShe wished that those few weeks could last forever. But graduation came, unrelentingly. \n+++\nThe graduating class, so far removed from the scared freshman who had walked through the gates four years ago, was lined up in a corner of the green. \nFinally given the cue, they marched down the greens and through the Van Wickle gates. The line unwound itself through the gates, revealing students with varying looks of exuberation and sadness. One graduate, immediately after passing through the gates, looked around wildly, as if searching for something. Seemingly not finding what she was looking for, she continued walking down the street, betrayed by the shuddering sobs that punctuated each step she took.\n+++\n\nNo-rae had put on a brave face in front of her family, tear streaks wiped away and the tremor in her voice disguised with an artificial cheeriness. She had gone through the motions, had put on a good show of it—pointing out the assorted landmarks and buildings around campus. \nShe had thought it would be fine. Had also known there was no way that it could be fine. Had said her last goodbyes, had already let go of Luce so many times. Had cried, more than she had thought possible, until the tears had dried up and only the painful memories remained. Had somehow, she thought, come to accept the cruel reality of it all. And so. She had put on a brave face, had wiped away her tears, had hidden away the desperation, had put on a good show. And so, she had thought that she was done saying goodbye, had resolved, while recalling the sing-song greetings they had shared and the soft silkiness of Luce’s hair on those lazy Saturday afternoons, that she wasn’t going to cry. \nBut, as she stood underneath the pale summer moon, as she tried to swallow the lump that rose in her throat, tried to choke back the sob that exploded out, she knew that nothing could have really prepared her for this. Luce was gone. Really gone. \nHuge, shivering sobs wracked her body. She fell against Blueno, tears streaming down her face and carving rivulets of color down the dust on Blueno’s legs. Hoping, against all odds, that things could go back to the way that they had been, that Luce was still with her. But the hard, unfeeling metal of the sculpture was unfamiliar. It was not the warmness of Luce’s touch, nor was it her comforting presence. She stayed that way for a long time, until the tears had dried up and the hollowness in her stomach had stopped burning and was now just sitting there, numb. \nShe pulled out a card that she had prepared and placed it in front of Blueno. \nDear Blueno,\nThanks.\n\nA final goodbye. She turned around and left.\n+++\nPassing in front of Blueno on her way to the train station the following morning, No-rae took a careful look at the sculpture. The card was gone, a purple iris in its place.\n+++\nepilogue\nThe new incoming first years—the class of 2023—spilled over the street between the two libraries. Fresh-faced and full of nervousness and anticipation, they waited for someone to tell them when they could walk through the gates. Among them, one girl in the middle of the crowd shuffled her feet nervously. Otherwise unremarkable, she stood out, if only for the brilliant purple iris that she wore in her hair.\n+ + + + + \n\n@ all readers, thanks for reading this final story! \n\nI’d like to thank all my friends for putting up with me not shutting up about this story for the past month, esp. @the yellow house on john st. and also for making these past 4 years at Brown really worth it.

Is it like some company contracted by Brown, or is it part of Brown in the same way Facilites Management, EMS, and other things are? More importantly is it considered a business that is trying to make profit, or just a service to the university that we need to pay for to access (as in like classes at the Nelson or something)? I’m mainly asking because I don’t understand why its so expensive. I actually think that the Ratty and VDub are somewhat fairly priced based on the price you get per swipe (not the out-of-pocket cost for one meal, that’s bullshit) considering that they’re buffets and you’re paying for the delivery/preparation/workers/etc, not just the food. But what I don’t understand is why Campus Market/Jo’s/Andrews and other places that sell food items that were not prepared by BUDS are so unaffordable. As another poster mentioned, how can Brown claim to care about food security but then charge like $4 for a Cliff Bar? We have the space in Campus Market and the market in Jo’s to have groceries at normal prices. That’s literally the easiest and most efficacious solution: sell more actual groceries in Campus Market rather than mainly candy and chips and soda, and sell them to break even, not to rob us blind (a lot of the items in CM aren’t even marked with prices). And while we’re here tho, let’s also acknowledge ResLife’s role in this. If ResLife would either maintain the decaying kitchens in dorms, stop turning the few existing kitchens into rooms, and/or let people off campus so they can actually have a kitchen that’s accessible, more people would actually be able to cook affordable meals instead of paying out the ass for BUDS or eating unhealthy (and also prohibitively expensive) food from Thayer street.\n","date":"May 26, 2019, 7:12 PM"},{"content":"6888 - cw: meal plan\n.\n.\n.\n.\nIf Brown truly cared about “food security,” then thousands of dollars worth of meal credits wouldn’t go to waste at the end of each school year.\n","date":"May 26, 2019, 7:12 PM"},{"content":"6887 - cant wait to have four orders of \"french fries\" from jos\n","date":"May 26, 2019, 7:12 PM"},{"content":"6886 - now that stem is banned from brown, can anyone recommend any humanities concentrations?\n","date":"May 26, 2019, 7:12 PM"},{"content":"6885 - cw: meal plan\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThe only reason why sophomores now have to be on meal plan is because Dining Services lost money this year.

I was looking forward to cooking my meals, eating healthy, and saving serious money but instead, as my FA package is one for lower middle income families, I will have to take out a student loan to afford this. Consider this as well: without the meal plan I can afford to buy my groceries on a weekly basis from my job income. Now, I have to take a 7.5% 10-year loan on 5,550.

Trying to fix the food insecurity problem by forcing a one-size-fits-all solution on the very people it (evidently) wasn't fitting - the people who were opting out of meal plan in the first place - is not a viable solution.\n\nEvery few years, someone does an analysis of meal plan prices (http://www.browndailyherald.com/2019/02/21/reed-21-meal-plan-pricing-limits-students-options/, http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/09/23/meal-plan-offerings-dish-out-varied-per-meal-values/, http://www.browndailyherald.com/2010/09/23/editorial-meal-plan-math/) and comes to the same conclusion: that while every meal plan is a massive rip-off, the highest-priced ones are the least bad, in that they have the lowest cost per meal. This has remained consistent even as the cost of meal plans has soared, increasing by more than 25% over the last six years to nearly $6000/yr (https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/institutional-research/sites/brown.edu.about.administration.institutional-research/files/uploads/CDS_2013-14.pdf, https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/financial-aid/tuition-and-fees).\n\nThe high meal plan prices can in turn incentivize overeating, as students (especially on the 20/wk plan) may feel pressured to eat their money's worth. After all, every unused meal at the end of the week / every unused point at the end of the year quite literally leads to money vanishing into thin air.\n\nMaking this even worse is that, according to the Today@Brown letter, Brown is aware of less heavy-handed alternatives which they are choosing to ignore: \"\"These [recommendations] include working with students to identify and expand food options that match student schedules as well as curricular and co-curricular demands; offering regular transportation to affordable grocery stores; and bringing an at-cost grocery store or cooperative on or near campus.\"\"\n\nIf the University truly cared about solving food insecurity, they could start by solving the problems with the meal plan that cause (35% of, per https://www.brown.edu/news/2019-05-23/food) sophomores to opt out in the first place. Instead, by abusing its power to force a system that doesn't adequately serve certain students on those very students, Brown and Brown Dining Services are making one thing abundantly clear: that extorting upwards of $5000 from even more of the student body by not allowing them to make their own decisions takes priority over actually serving students.\n","date":"May 24, 2019, 4:19 PM"},{"content":"6831 - cw: meal plan\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nDoes anyone know if there is a way to get an exception for the sophomore meal plan requirement?

If you’re cheating, it means you’re doing something considered outside the “rules” to do better. Cheating is reliant on a bunch of people not cheating to work - otherwise no advantage is gained. So by cheating you’re inherently acting on the belief that your success is more important and/or more deserved than that of those around you, particularly in competitive environments (such as college and especially classes graded in a curve).\n\nBasically what I’m saying is the “everybody can do it” defense is disingenuous because you know that there’s no point in cheating unless you expect the majority of others to not cheat; you’re reliant on compliance from most people in order for your cheating to be beneficial.\n\nSo yeah, don’t fucking cheat.

They also can never imagine so many of the hardships that come with being low-income. They will never experience systematic and institutional discrimination based on their income (or likely their race as well). BUT, there are problems in our society that affect all people - mental health, family issues, etc. It is one thing to joke about eating the rich. It is another to say you could never have sympathy for anyone who comes from money. It erases so many people’s experiences and hardships. \n\nThat being said, people who hold identities that have been historically oppressed/discriminated against face this type of erasure all the time. That’s horrible. But do you want to drag others down so they can feel that same pain? Especially those who had no part in creating the privilege they have. \n\nThis may sound like a “not all men” kind of argument and it definitely has its similarities. However, the point I’m trying to make is that it should not be applauded to shit on entire groups of people and erase their hardships. The experiences of rich people will never equate to the hardships and discrimination that people from other identities experience, but it is still wrong to say you could never have sympathy (or things to a similar effect) for an entire group of people who are still going through their own shit.\n","date":"May 24, 2019, 4:17 PM"},{"content":"6822 - Is anyone in Seoul this summer that I can hang out with?\n","date":"May 24, 2019, 4:17 PM"},{"content":"6821 - People at this school are so passive aggressive and are terrible at conflict resolution.\n","date":"May 24, 2019, 4:16 PM"},{"content":"6820 - cw: meal plan\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\ninstead of requiring sophomores to remain on meal plan, brown should make it a priority to provide transportation to grocery stores (specifically, less expensive ones). i know they mentioned that in their write-up, but that should’ve been priority #1! i was off meal plan this past year and it was quite difficult to go grocery shopping for a couple of different reasons (that i *know* aren’t just unique to me):\n\n1.) lack of nearby, cheap grocery stores. you think i can afford to pay $5 for a half gallon of milk!?! \n2.) lack of safe and reliable transportation. while there *are* options, like taking ripta or utilizing on-call, these aren’t always reliable and/or time effective. maybe brown should have some kind of shuttle service specifically for grocery shopping? \n3.) fluctuations in my ability. i have several disabilities and neurodivergences that make it difficult for me to have a routine grocery shopping schedule. there have been weeks at a time where i am too ill or fatigued to make the trek to the grocery store, mostly because it requires at least some degree of walking (even walking six minutes to the bus stop can be absolutely draining).\n\ni know not all of these issues can be solved instantly, but i really think brown should be addressing these issues instead of funneling more student money into meal plans. :(\n","date":"May 24, 2019, 4:16 PM"},{"content":"6819 - This meal plan change is so frustrating!

Very differently, but also similarly, those who cheated on their exams - we will NEVER know why they chose to do that. Maybe they are a selfish person, but maybe they were instead a fellow student who is on the brink of a meltdown, or contemplating suicide, or in danger of being disowned/beaten by their parents if they bring home a “bad grade” — whatever! The point is we literally don’t know and won’t know, but lacking the compassion to consider what a tough position they *may* be in is not really helpful for you or for them.

The Nazis instituted major public works projects such as the Autobahn, promised full employment, and dramatically increased government spending.\n\nOn the other hand, the Nazis were virulently anti-communist.

Take it or leave it.\n\n\"\"Besides that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the show?\"\"\n\nI didn't like the GOT finale. I also thought the majority of it was good. Sansa's coronation got me, as did Jon and Arya's endings. The score and the cinematography were spectacular as always, and I just loved the scene of Brienne writing down Jaime’s history (a moment that ultimately, though, would have felt more earned had they not slept together). But Bran. Ew.\n\nNot only is Bran's storyline under-developed (Can he see the future? Why does the Knight King care about him? Can he warg into a dragon, and if so, why didn't he stop the massacre of ep. 5? Is he a person?), but, in the most ideal case, he represents a shallow understanding of humanity that GOT was generally so great at rising above.\n\nThe ideal of Bran is that, the more we know, the less human we become. They’ve certainly made that clear, and I think it’s an interesting notion. If only you knew the whole of history, you would renounce your family, emotions, and humanity, to become a sort of walking (or, er, not walking in Bran's case) book. Not only does knowledge entail dehumanization, in Bran, but this disembodied \"\"knowledge\"\" is what we need from our leaders! We, according to this ending, should not be led by men or women with those simple things called emotions. We should rise above! To the ideal of a robot expert historian! \n\nGive me a break. This is absurd. Thrones, at its greatest, illustrates both the inevitability of our human interests, and the BEAUTY OF THEM! (Think back to Ygritte and Jon at Castle Black). We cannot and should not live in an abstracted world of pure technocracy. I could learn everything there is to learn, and I would still identify with my family, as Bran previously claims not to...Would I want a president who claimed allegiance to abstract humanity over his life projects? NO! For more on the general philosophical approach I'm suggesting, read Bernard Williams on integrity. The utilitarian assumptions of Bran's elevation represent an epic failure. I struggle to see past it, because it ultimately pushes aside what I thought Thrones was slowly building towards (\"\"How can we, humans, govern ourselves, given that we have to?\"\") with a negation of the whole project (\"\"let's let a non-human do it...\"\") \n\nThink about what the episode could have been! As Jon and Tyrion spoke in Tyrion's cell, we saw two flawed characters struggling with tough decisions with epic implications. It is not that these could have made better decisions if they weren't flawed and subjective, but because subjective characters are only ones that make sense! \n\nGreat fantasy reflects the human condition. Benioff and Weiss resolved to deny it.\n\nGame of Thrones - you were an incredible show, then a brilliant one, and then a tepid one (the series, in my estimation, began to lose sight of itself when main characters became invincible). At least we’ll always have the first 4 seasons.\n","date":"May 21, 2019, 5:45 PM"},{"content":"6718 - the brown u. naked society is coordinating weekend carpools to dyer woods this summer! https://fb.me/buns.fyi\nUpdated May 21, 2019, 5:44 PM\n","date":"May 21, 2019, 5:44 PM"},{"content":"6717 - motion to disband the football team and replace it with women's rugby\n","date":"May 21, 2019, 5:44 PM"},{"content":"6716 - does anyone at brown have experience using diva cups? i really want to hop on the diva cup train for ~sustainability~ reasons, but i've shockingly never used a tampon before (pads only for family reasons), so i'm not sure how to go about it. any tips?\n","date":"May 21, 2019, 5:44 PM"},{"content":"6715 - When are all grades submitted?\n","date":"May 21, 2019, 5:44 PM"},{"content":"6714 - cw: game of thrones ending\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nEvery part of this finale and season 8 was fantastic except the writing (and a maybe a few filming errors/flaws such as poor lighting and letting a Starbucks cup and water bottle make it into the final cut).

One person said that even if a fetus is a person, it’s wrong for the fetus to take from the mother without the mother’s consent. Well it’s also kind of wrong to erase the fetus’s life and future without its consent, when it had no intention of “taking” from the mother. That’s why the consent thing really doesn’t make sense. I think the most convincing pro-choice argument is that practically you’re preventing a lot of pain and suffering to both parties by avoiding having an unwanted child.

I’m genuinely curious. I understand you think this is an attack on your bodies. It’s not. We have restrictions on the use of everyone’s bodies for the sake of preventing harm to others. For example, I can’t swing my arms at you because that would harm you, and we all agree to these restrictions on my body for the sake of the common good. When you have consensual sex, you do so with the knowledge that you could create a human being (deserving of protections and rights), who is in a state of vulnerability that only the mother can help. I’m not pro-life, but I’m familiar with pro-life arguments, and all I want is a rebuttal to that argument. Is a fetus not a person deserving of rights (and if so, when does personhood and its ensuing rights get endowed to a human)?\n","date":"May 19, 2019, 2:49 PM"},{"content":"6642 - Where tf is my CS22 grade?

This is a question of science. A fertilized egg is alive by definition, and is a member of the species Homo sapiens, as indicated by its unique human DNA, by almost all conceptions of species classification. The debate about abortion is one of values. What is a person? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood\nIt is, again, fairly uncontroversial that, at least in the United States, all people have a constitutionally protected right to life, until that right is relinquished by some act such as putting someone else’s life in danger, for example. \n\nThe abortion debate is about at what point in human development do we assign the label of person, or alternatively, at what point in human development do we say that human rights are endowed. If at conception, it follows fairly immediately that abortion should be illegal in almost all cases barring danger to the life of the mother. Some have proposed other points where personhood begins: when the heart starts beating, viability outside the womb, or point of birth. \n\nSome common misconceptions:\n\n1. Men are forcing pro-life policy on women as the tyrannical majority. Fact: Women are just as likely to identify as pro-life as men according to recent Gallup polling. States in which pro-life bills were passed where all passed by majorities in state congress, whom were elected by a majority women electorate, and in 2 cases (Iowa and Alabama) were signed into law by female governors. \n2. Pro-life people just want to control women’s bodies and hate women. Fact: About half of women identify as pro-life. Oops!\n3. Abortion is now illegal in many states across the country. Fact: none of the heartbeat bills or Alabama’s abortion ban have gone into effect, and none of them will, in all likelihood, until a case challenging them reaches the highest court. \n\nGuidelines for debate:\n\n1. Pro-choice and pro-life folks both, in general, have good intentions, care about human rights, care about women, care about babies, and want a just resolution to the abortion debate. Treat them as such.\n2. People who have opposing perspectives are not evil. \n3. Look for meaningful distinctions as to why your belief in the cutoff for human rights is where it is. Ask yourself if those same reasons could be applied to a different cutoff. Ask if that cutoff is consistent with intuitions etc.\n4. Have an actual thought based discussion; don’t shout people down or use ad hominem attacks.\nUpdated May 18, 2019, 2:49 PM\n","date":"May 18, 2019, 2:49 PM"},{"content":"6639 - okay question: is it possible for a professor to change my grade on my transcript from S to S with distinction if I took the class in the fall?

It’s disturbing that small groups of old men are literally endangering the lives of all women in their states. As I said in the CW, my views on abortion are somewhat mixed. What that means is that I’m fully supportive of abortion as a reproductive right, even when factors like rape/safety are not involved. No one should be forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term. With that said, I just disagree with the idea that any regulation of abortion is inherently immoral. Again, I personally don’t support any restrictions on abortion, but to say that those who do support bans on late-term abortions are evil and misogynistic is unfair.

Professor Shin was, in my opinion, being extremely fair by giving us plenty of exam questions that we had seen before on either homeworks or previous midterms. All of the answers to those questions are uploaded on Canvas. So apparently a bunch of students who I guess didn’t feel like studying like the rest of us went on their phones during the exam (I’m guessing in bathroom) to get the answers. I guess teachers can like check when we’ve logged into canvas, so Professor Shin noticed an unusual amount of logins during the exam period, so he knew exactly who cheated. Accordingly he didn’t give those students their exam grades back, and for the rest of us, for betraying his trust I guess, he decided last minute to not post the grade cut-offs and supposedly raise the cut-offs if we needed to cheat so badly. Now this is just my opinion, but I feel professor Shin has been completely fair all semester in his approach that he’d rather teach us what he thinks we ought to know and lower the cutoffs, rather than provide us with incomplete information.

CO2 lasts for hundreds of years in the atmosphere, and then only goes into other forms of the carbon cycle slowly over thousands of years (or never).\n\nFirstly, there is a delay in air temperature increase. This means that the carbon already emitted will take 40 years to reach its full potential. This is largely due to the slow process of Earth's oceans warming. In many ways, we're feeling the emissions of the 80's right now.\n\nThere are feedback loops. As the planet warms, the oceans cannot absorb as much CO2. Methane, which works on scales of hundreds of years instead of thousands(but is much more effective at heating), will be released more and more on large swaths of land as time goes on.\n\nOther feedback loops include deforestation and albedo effects, melting ice caps, and increasing water vapor which will only amplify the damage that has already been done.\n\nThink about that: If we did the impossible and switched entirely to 100%, zero-emission, fictional renewables today and provided zero carbon footprint... We'd still be in dire conditions for generations to come.\n\nFrom a wildlife standpoint - even more grim news. Every animal on the planet is dropping. Recent studies estimate 58% of all wildlife has died since 1970. The U.N. has warned 1 million species are at risk of extinction. We are in an extinction event that is ten to one-hundred times the rate of any other extinction on Earth, save the giant impact event. It seems like hyperbole, but it isn't. We are currently undergoing (at least) the second-fastest extinction in the planet's history.\n\nClimate-deniers like to call people like me who agree with the global consensus of scientists \"\"alarmists.\"\" You're fucking right I'm an alarmist.

The administration is hostile to spaces and events that are traditionally fun for college students – at least in my eyes. Greek life is being neutered, pushing people to unsafe off-campus spaces.

There are so many students on campus who want this type of “traditional” college experience – and I know y’all know *exactly* what I mean by that – but the school simply isn’t giving a space for it. Gone are the times when all the fraternity doors on Wriston quad were open and you could feel welcome at any party. Now parties are getting more and more exclusive and unwelcoming. The only traditionally fun ones these days are the ones off campus. For an administration that’s so money-focused, you’d think they’d want to foster a tighter community on-campus, where people actually associate being at Brown with being “fun.” I know people can have fun in other ways, I just wanted to vent about what I see as a fun part of campus that used to be very present being forced out.\n","date":"May 10, 2019, 4:18 PM"},{"content":"6229 - Is there any place on campus where I can scan documents?\n","date":"May 10, 2019, 4:18 PM"},{"content":"6228 - Can we bring l*mon discourse back?

People have been posting about how they don't feel comfortable sharing their political opinions because of fear of backlash, but the comments have been entirely unapologetic about the attacks on character of any post that doesn't perfectly agree with them. To be honest, on most issues, I actually agree with the end goals of the commenters. I wish that we didn't make stereotypes. I acknowledge that I have my own racial/gender/etc. biases, and I work constantly to correct these biases and reduce their impact on my behavior. I am frustrated by the deep-rooted societal roadblocks put up for non-Christians, LGBTQ people, and people of color. But I think the response to these issues needs to be more compassionate towards the people who are part of the problem. I don't blame the racist for their racism. Racism does not disappear when we call it out. It merely makes the racist resent us more, making them increasingly resistant to changing their opinions.\n\nResponses need to be measured according to the degree of the offense. If someone defends rape or Hitler or slavery, it is reasonable to respond as agrily as many on this page do. But the behavior I've seen on this page tends to respond with much more vitriol than the situation necessitates. Commenters tend to assume the most offensive possible wording to what they read. When someone writes that they notice angry attitudes towards white men that may overcompensate for racism and sexism, people hear \"\"white guys are angry because other people are getting the same privileges they already had.\"\" While that really may be true in some cases, I think the majority of people who notice this attitude are actually speaking from examples of actual hostility they've experienced. And while these experiences may be more mild than those experienced by their more marginalized peers, that doesn't mean that those issues are not still worth looking into.\n\nYour angry attitudes, while they might demonstrate your progressive views to your peers, do not change anyone's mind. It isolates you into an echo chamber where everyone inside your group applauds each other on how woke you've become, while shaming everyone outside equally for being anything less than perfectly progressive.\n","date":"May 9, 2019, 6:54 AM"},{"content":"6115 - I have spent half my day waiting for the scili elevator\n","date":"May 9, 2019, 6:53 AM"},{"content":"6114 - help i literally can't join mealshare or buying and selling it won't work when i try to confirm the link sent in my email. please help a girl out i got like 170 credits im tryna get rid of here\n","date":"May 9, 2019, 6:53 AM"},{"content":"6113 - does anyone have any advice about backpacking in central/South America?? any must see sights or tips?\n","date":"May 9, 2019, 6:53 AM"},{"content":"6112 - Pollen should be classified as a biological weapon of mass destruction tbh\n","date":"May 9, 2019, 6:53 AM"},{"content":"6111 - Anyone know the typical A cutoff for Principles of Econ?\n","date":"May 9, 2019, 6:53 AM"},{"content":"6110 - @6088 I don’t see how veganism is “pushing values” onto animals.

I know I don't have the context, and if someone is already in there working you should ask them if they mind if you and your friends hang out in there. That being said, lounges are meant to be community spaces for people on the floor and their friends to hang around with other floormates. Yes, you can do work and study there, but they are not primarily meant to be study spaces, and I really don't think it's generally inconsiderate to talk and laugh and watch things in there, whether it's finals season or not (of course, it can be rude in specific circumstances like if it's loud while people are trying to sleep or intrusive to people who were already there).\n\nI think this relates to a more general trend here... living on campus is community living. This means you should be respectful of others by not blasting music at 3 am and by *flushing the toilet* and things like that.

Now i'm at Brown, and I realize how problematic they are. I've seen all of the posts, but I am struggling to reconcile this with my high school experience. i am wondering what to do in the future, if i'm invited to a high school party among these lines (people from my high school still throw parties during breaks etc), especially one that is thrown by a non-Mexican Latinx person. I figured if I'm invited to such a party by a Mexican person, that is alright because they are inviting me as a guest? I know it's not my place to throw one, or insert myself into this problematic thing.\n","date":"May 6, 2019, 6:53 PM"},{"content":"6026 - I might get Cs in two of my classes and I’m freaking out.

But slowly and gradually this group has descended into a toxic space for people to air their grievances and issues with everything and bash groups and individuals under the veil of anonymity. The purpose of this post isn't to call anyone out or to express discontent but instead it is a plea to move on towards a more productive and positive discourse from which everyone can benefit. One of the greatest aspects of being at Brown that their exist so many resources and people who are willing to listen to you and to help you. It is a space where people are empathetic, cognisant and accommodating of others. \n\nSure, there may be times where we are particularly aggrieved by an issue or are particularly angry about something, but hiding that resentment under the veil of anonymity in the hope that other people comment in support and add to the negative discourse is not the solution. If you feel strongly about a certain group on campus, approach their members and actually talk to them out their experiences and maybe your opinion might change. If someone's behaviour is particularly discomforting to you, approach the said person and try to talk out the differences. If you feel strongly about a specific political opinion, stand by it and try to talk to as many people about to put your point across. You will be amazed by how much airing your opinions and feelings to other people in person can make a difference to a situation. All of have the ability to listen and to reason and a person may be willing to listen to you or be mindful around you in the future. So many of our opinions about groups on campus or organisations are framed by what people tell us but if you actually talk to members of a said group, you will learn how different they are to the image you hold of them in your head. \n\nI believe that the existence of this group is healthy and is necessary so we can allow people who can't express themselves in public to air their feelings and receive help on genuine issues. What I don't agree with is the way this group is being used to espouse hateful feelings and is becoming an echo chamber where people come to affirm their own opinions to get comfort while at the same time causing discomfort to the wider Brown community. So next time you have a grievance or strong sentiment to across, do it in person and you will realise how much of difference it can make to making yourself feel better and the other person or group more mindful of their actions and behaviours.\n","date":"May 6, 2019, 10:47 AM"},{"content":"6012 - Wishing all those celebrating Ramadan a wonderful month.

And more recently, If a Minecraft world is infinite, how does the sun travel around it?\n\nContrary to popular belief, the Minecraft world is actually infinite, in the sense that a single seed can theoretically generate an infinite world. It’s impossible to travel more than 29,999,994 blocks in any direction (and I don’t think you can set the worldborder any higher), but the world generation doesn’t stop there - you can go to the “edge” of the world and see the world go on far past the border.\n\nIt is also known that the Minecraft world is flat, not a sphere or cube. We know this because the gravitational force is constant no matter how high you go, which is true for infinite flat worlds (with thickness) but not with a sphere or cube.\n\nSomething else interesting is that no matter how high you go, the sun stays the same size. You’d think that if the sun were a certain distance from the overworld then it would appear bigger as you moved closer. Furthermore, the sun does go down over the horizon without (as far as we know) moving through the overworld.\n\nTherefore, we have reached the conclusion that the sun is infinitely far away from the Minecraft world - so infinitely far away that it goes beyond the infiniteness of the overworld. Though we have a problem - how can an infinitely far object have any apparent size? For instance, if you were to travel further and further away from our sun, it would become smaller and smaller until it eventually disappeared. This is true for any object of finite size, which leads us to the next conclusion - that the Minecraft sun is infinitely large.\n\nTo summarize, the Minecraft sun is not a large ball in the sky - it is an infinitely large mass an infinite distance away from the overworld.\n","date":"May 6, 2019, 10:46 AM"},{"content":"5996 - Anyone ever tell you that you look just like my aunty Henrietta? cause ya do!

Dear Blueno truly represents the worst Brown has to offer - and I wish I could attribute that to anonymity or irony or memes, but it truly is the people that believe the things they post that alarm me. I'm not just referring to any singular issue or one side of a debate - everyone who posts or comments on this page religiously seriously needs to take a look in the mirror. The absolute worst part is that a lot of you stand behind your awful opinions in the comments - I'm not sure if you realize this but people genuinely dislike a lot of you guys and it's really scary that you feel so comfortable saying some of the things you do. It's alarming that you feel vindicated by the likes you get on your posts and comments and fail to recognize that shitty people agreeing with your opinions doesn't make the stuff you believe okay or correct. You're so self-assured in your world view that none of you can even consider that you might not be 100% right. Instead of desperately defending all of your awful opinions in the comments you should maybe add just a tiny bit of nuance to your views. I literally have no stake in Dear Blueno or any of these issues so I hope you can appreciate that I'm sincere in this opinion.

This question can be asked of both sides. Does the oppression of the Palestinians give them the right to launch rockets indiscriminately into Israeli cities? If not, does their plight at least lead us to excuse their violence out of sympathy? \n\nSimilarly, does the past and current oppression of the Jewish people give Israel the right to defend itself with more force? For many in Israel, the wounds of the Holocaust are still there. Just this past week, many Holocaust survivors saw rockets raining down their grandkids largely because they live in the one Jewish state in the Middle East. Is it fair to tell them they’re too powerful and advanced of a country to fight back? Just because they’re a westernized country with a modernized military, doesn’t mean the people they protect haven’t been historically oppressed and murdered.\n\nTLDR: Both the Jewish people and the Palestinian people have been oppressed.

But they must do so at their own risk, as there is an 80% that it’s sharpness will slice off their finger in an instant.\n\nAfter watching pick up artists on YouTube, I have learned how to say “hello”, in the exact pitch and tone such that the vibration from my vocal chords travels directly to the cervix of all women in the vicinity and IMMEDIATELY makes them orgasm. I now have a gaggle of thousands of women following me at all times, each literally BEGGING for just the chance to make me cum. I let one of them perform fellatio on me on occasion, but I make sure to never cum, as A) the pure force from the nut of my manly penis might kill them and B) semen retention is the biggest secret to all my power.

I always thought all the PLME jokes were just for the memes but turns out apparently some people mean what they say. So my 2 cents on the issue:\n\nTo all the people who are bitter PLME rejects and to the people who think they’re a head taller than everyone else at this school because they’re PLME (specifically, the PLME students who have automatically assumed that I’m somehow jealous of their “PLME status” as a non PLME premed): newsflash, being PLME doesn’t mean someone is better or special in some way. People in the PLME program are about as cool as every other person on this campus. I was originally interested in PLME, but my college counselor literally advised me against applying for it. His argument, in addition to being concerned I would tie myself to somewhere and something I would no longer want to do/live at after 4 years of undergrad and limit my experiences that way, was that if I really still wanted to be a doctor after 4 years, I should trust my ability to be able to apply and get accepted into other med schools that might suit me better than Alpert instead of what was in his eyes, trapping myself into a seemingly super enticing and easy way into med school. According to him, there is a reason why none of the so called “best” med schools offer 8 year programs: one of the purposes of an 8 year program is to ensure that med schools can attract and retain a certain type of student straight out of high school that they would otherwise have trouble attracting during regular med school application season based on the reputation of said med school alone. There are plenty of awesome people who don’t apply to PLME. There are plenty of awesome people who apply and don’t get in and that doesn’t make them any more or less cool. They just weren’t the type of person the program was looking for that particular year (just like hot take: being a brown student doesn’t mean you’re cooler or not cooler than someone at any other school, for the same reasons)\n\nThat being said, after being a few semesters at Brown and seeing, for example, how limited in the open curriculum you are by med school requirements, there are very, very legitimate draws to being PLME. So for people who have chosen to be in PLME for reasons other than “now I never have to take the MCAT and can go fuck around the next 4 years,” kudos to you for being cool and I hope being PLME has been everything you hoped it would be. \n\nIn summary, PLME is a legitimately cool program but at the same time, way overhyped and not as big of a deal as some people appear to be making it out to be. If you’re PLME, congrats. If you’re not PLME, congrats as well.\n","date":"May 4, 2019, 10:45 AM"},{"content":"5891 - hey\n","date":"May 4, 2019, 10:45 AM"},{"content":"\"5890 - anyone know what's up w the mens frisbee's pizza? like, is this homemade homemade or boxed pizza put in a microwave?\n\nno shade at all, just wondering, im hungry for sum gud pizZa ♥\"\n","date":"May 4, 2019, 10:45 AM"},{"content":"5889 - What's the deal with Senior Scramble?

The video went through the history of jewish communities repeated persecutions, through their struggle, then transitioning into how now, with israel they (the video said 'we') are finally safe. I've seen and heard stories like this time after time that so often tend to transition into why israel is such a great place. This video said \"\"come 1948, everything changed (leading into how now everyone is safe). I'll be honest, the line disturbed me. When I think of the year 1948, I absolutely do not think of safety. I do not think of community. I do not think of welcomeness, there is no light at the end of that tunnel. When I think 1948, I think of my grandfather. In 1948, he was bombed out of his home in Jerusalem and died never returning. He lost cousins, friends, aunts and uncles. He lost a home and everything that home encompasses. Thinking about the year 1948 and all of the innocent Palestinian lives that were (and remain) so entirely altered makes me want to cry. Israel has stolen my family's home. The 'we' that the video talked about did not include my Palestinian identity because inadvertently, the establishment of Israel has murdered so many of us. I understand a community's yearning for a home. What I do not understand, however, is how that community in turn can so blindly rob others of theirs. I've felt the same pain course through my body when I see the killings of innocents at synagogues and the hatred that drives it. How could any human not feel that pain? All I urge, to all of you, regardless of your political affiliations, is that you take a hard look and consider the lives that you ignore. We all are guilty of ignoring life around us and in this case it is especially easy given our geographic removal from this conflict. But really, this video really just made me want to cry. I still have family members in and around Jerusalem that are just entirely mistreated on the daily. Still they laugh, still they cry, still they live. They are life too. We are life too. I just am so frustrated that for some reason that fact is so easily ignored.\n","date":"May 4, 2019, 10:42 AM"},{"content":"5855 - cornell has steve aoki and galantis for their slope days bca needs to up their game\n","date":"May 4, 2019, 10:42 AM"},{"content":"5854 - is taking cs19 after cs4 doable?\n","date":"May 4, 2019, 10:42 AM"},{"content":"\"5853 - cw: mental health??\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\ni don't know what's wrong with me \ni'm so tired all the time but i literally sleep 9 hours a night \nit's not physical tiredness, it's just that going through my day to day life is suddenly exhausting??? even stupid stuff like brushing my teeth and walking to the library \ni am so done with myself \"\n","date":"May 4, 2019, 10:42 AM"},{"content":"5852 - https://youtu.be/gjzeNBSZFUo\n","date":"May 4, 2019, 10:42 AM"},{"content":"5851 - How does one get more involved with student groups at Brown?

In a battle of sheer strength, Remy would wipe the floor with Stuart Little.\n\nStrength is not only about strength but smarts and tactics. Once again, Remy wins. Stuart Little is but a child. While bright for a kid, he's by no means a genius and his brain is underdeveloped. Remy is a hyper intelligent adult rat with an intensive knowledge on the culinary arts. No war was ever won on an empty stomach. Remy has a special ability to control humans by manipulating the hair on their heads.

Remy has the support of his father, his brother, hundreds of Parisian rats, a fully staffed restaurant, and every food critic in Paris.

First of all, their acceptance to other schools means nothing. We all know college admissions is a gamble. Even if it DID mean something, your examples don't represent the entire PLME population. In fact, I can give you a handful of PLME's who chose Brown over whatever you consider a \"better school,\" and I can give you dozens of PLME's who literally were just lucky and probably chosen for some random reason out of their control. I also know people who did absolutely crazy stuff in high school (literally first authors on published papers, took upper level pre-med requirements, etc) who did not get into PLME, and lots of PLME's who just shadowed a doctor one summer and wrote about it (or even better, have no special accomplishments or extraordinary academic signaling of being a good doctor but have personal circumstances relating to medicine that make them stand out. Not to say this isn't important, but why does it merit a spot in med school immediately out of high school when other more qualified students work their butts off in college for the same spot?). It angers me when people think \"the fact that they're PLME means they're smart and worked super hard in high school,\" when PLME's are literally just as qualified and smart as any other Brown student. Minus a few exceptions, if someone is qualified enough, what gets them into the program is simple luck. This is coming from a non-premed person who has many PLME and regular pre-med friends, and who has done extensive research on college admissions.\n","date":"May 3, 2019, 4:58 AM"},{"content":"5808 - How do I get involved in NDR?\n","date":"May 3, 2019, 4:58 AM"},{"content":"5807 - For yom hashoah, let’s all take a moment to remember the millions of brave Jews, poles, queer and differently abled people, sinti, Roma, poc, and others murdered under the guise of national socialism.

I found it cinematically magnificent (the flaming swords burning out, Arya's quiet scene, the music throughout), emotionally wrenching (the Hound getting up for Arya, the doubt on the red woman's face as she can't light the fire on her first few tries, Theon's redemption, Tyrion's insecurity), and even politically interesting (Missandei eating Sansa's lunch in the crypts)...but I can't pretend I didn't want to see some more from the night king. What did our guy want?!? If you're going to tell me that the white walkers were created by the children of the forest as pure death, in order to kill the first men, such that to expect agency is to anthropomorphize characters that were designed to have no real agency, I'd say fuck you. We see the night king smile, so that motherfucker has emotions! I would've loved more there. Furthermore, the tense buildup of watching that smug little bitch walk for 8 seasons now feels undeserved after seeing him die that quickly.\n\nStill, amazing experience. Thrilling, tiring in all the best ways, but Thrones continues to suffer in its later seasons as beloved characters develop plot armour (I can't count the amount of times last night when Jon Snow or Dany or Sam or Jaime was surrounded by the dead in one scene and then safe in the next scene).\n","date":"Apr 29, 2019, 6:00 PM"},{"content":"5642 - does anyone know if the BSA storage lottery vouchers have already been given out / when?\n","date":"Apr 29, 2019, 6:00 PM"},{"content":"5641 - What is the difficulty of the Treil linear algebra final relative to the midterms?\n","date":"Apr 29, 2019, 6:00 PM"},{"content":"5640 - why do people play music and videos out loud in common spaces?? not everyone wants to listen to ur music at this very moment in time!!!\n","date":"Apr 29, 2019, 6:00 PM"},{"content":"5639 - @the girl in the rock stacks who was on the phone - it's not hard to go down to the lobby for two seconds.\n","date":"Apr 29, 2019, 4:44 PM"},{"content":"5638 - Does anybody have an idea for the S cutoff for apma 1650?

But when you’re squeezed in a tight space, pressed up against other people at spring weekend, it is completely inappropriate to be engaging in intense physical affection or whatever you wanna call it.

I couldn’t move away (was literally trapped on all sides between several people) and I didn’t feel I had the authority to ask them to stop. Although their intentions were harmless, I would argue that this was a form of sexual harassment and possibly assault. I’m not permanently traumatized or anything, but for someone more sensitive to something like this (a sexual violence survivor, or really anyone who’s uncomfortable witnessing PDA), this could be a really difficult thing to encounter.

Notice that he trashed Yaeji’s production, not her voice- admitting it’s pleasant. He praises Daniel Caesar at some points. \n\nFurther, what did you expect from a SKEPTIC’s guide? Don’t read it if you just want to hear praise about the artists. Also, please note that the writer is not trashing spring weekend or BCA- just stating his opinion on the ARTISTS, as any reviewer would. Don’t tell me none of you have ever trashed musicians before. For lack of a better example- Nickelback? Justin Bieber? \n\nMoreover, a lot of you complain about a lot of things on campus. If the writer were complaining- which he is not- why is that different than a lot of other inane things people complain about? (Of course, not talking about the bigger issues here- some things definitely need to be discussed.) Why is no one butthurt by that? \n\nAlso, while privilege and position is definitely always a factor in the back of everyone’s minds, I firmly believe that the critique focused on the musicians and their style, more than anything else. Yes, it’s easy to accidentally cross lines sometimes but there are also people who are all too willing to read identity issues into pieces that have nothing to do with identity, but everything to do with art. There is a distinction between art and artist. I say this as a POC and a female, for those who say that I’m arguing from a privileged perspective. \n\nLastly, the writer at no point says he wants to “bang” any of the artists. In fact, when talking about her explicit album cover, he seems to mention it more for the shock value, defiance, and in-your-faceness the artist was probably going for when she chose the artwork. If people bothered to read closely enough, they might see that. \n\nAs for people who think the focus shouldn’t be on who the people are performing for- why not? It’s definitely not a question central just to females. It’s a question a lot of artists have to ask themselves. \n\nI appreciate and understand that some of you may be offended and believe that there are other more heinous factors underlying the article, but I believe that thinking this would be reading too much into it. \n\nFinally, taking art- like music and writing- so seriously can sometimes crush its spirit. I think you guys need to lighten up. It’s not a personal attack on any of you. \n\nAnd to conclude, I think it would be best to leave the article alone as it is- a funny, well-written- albeit harsh- critique of musicians.\n","date":"Apr 27, 2019, 11:15 AM"},{"content":"5512 - cw: sw\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nthe shoving in the crowd was so awful\n","date":"Apr 27, 2019, 11:15 AM"},{"content":"5511 - cw: sw\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nlisten I know there have been some issues with SW so far, but can we stop hating on BCA? they have been working so hard to plan this massive event for us and ofc there will be bumps along the way. thank you BCA for all of your hard work!!\n","date":"Apr 27, 2019, 11:15 AM"},{"content":"5510 - I’ve never dealt with such unprofessional and rude staff in my life.

I’ve felt the way you’re feeling for most of college, and it took me until my senior year to finally seek treatment. I want you to know that your feelings and struggles are valid even if it doesn’t feel like it, and you deserve help and happiness. Re: not being able to express yourself at CAPS - I totally, 100% feel that, and that made me feel like I couldn’t go for a long time. Something that helped me a lot was writing out specific symptoms I was experiencing (sadness/emptiness, sleeping too much, lack of appetite, anxiety attacks, etc.) and how those were affecting me, and then just literally reading those out to the therapist. I ended up working with a wonderful therapist there who has helped me, over the past several months, to get to a point where I feel stable and happier. My therapist has also helped me deal with insecurities about my friendships that are quite similar to what you’ve described, and while that’s still a work in progress I’m definitely improving.\n\nMy point is, it can get better, even if the process isn’t linear and takes a lot of work. And you deserve to get better. Good luck with everything, it’s hard but you’re worth it.\n","date":"Apr 22, 2019, 6:57 PM"},{"content":"5280 - Everything will be okay.

The overly PC brigading and call out culture, the refusal to hear out the people on the other sides, the identity politics and resorting to name calling and seeing the other sides as enemies while we root for our equally apathetic political parties as if they're sports teams is what paved the way for Donald Trump. But, instead of any real self-reflection, people refuse to see the real issues and how much they contribute to them. All we did was plug our ears and got louder and angrier. This is not a fluke. It will only get worse with time if we refuse to address our own toxicity and treat politics like a game to be won while seeing each other as enemies instead of fellow citizens.

(Assuming ADOCH kids haven’t been keeping up to date with the Brown Divest movement, they won’t know that Divest has distanced themselves from the national BDS movement.)\n\nMy point is that I really don’t see how this protest was supposed to accomplish anything.

I can understand why people get frustrated when things fall to the TAs in the CS department.\n\nHowever, even if every professor did what they were supposed to all the time, there's only one of them for hundreds of students, and they may have not implemented the projects themselves, just designed them.

I know this is probably going to receive a lot of backlash so please read this full post and try to understand where I am coming from before wrecking me in the comments. CS is hard. Really fucking hard. The UTA program at the CS department is one of the best in the country, and we've had countless professors from other schools visit so that they can model programs after ours. Yes, it's unfortunate that we have to get most of our help from other undergrads who have only taken the course once. Yes, it's unfortunate that TAs have to put loads of energy into these courses to make them run smoothly. However, TAs are often not \"exploited\" for their work. While they certainly spent tremendous amounts of time TA-ing, they do receive either financial compensation, course credit, or both. And you can shit on the fact that TAs are sometimes more responsible for your education than your professor, but can you genuinely say your education is suffering? We have an extraordinary CS department, and at its current size and rate of growth we would simply not be able to function if we didn’t have the TA program in place. Furthermore, TAs make courses wayyyyyyy more accessible. Imagine taking CS15 with 350 other students and not having consistent hours to attend, or having to rely on the professor for help. Even if more professors held more office hours, there’s no way they’d be able to help every student in the course without working 24/7. Also (and I know this is gonna piss a lot of you off), but CS isn’t for everyone. Some people just simply shouldn’t be concentrating in the field. This isn’t to say that needing TA hours frequently, failing an assignment, failing a course, or just being genuinely confused means that you shouldn’t pursue a degree in CS, but unfortunately it’s still not for everyone. And while imposter syndrome is definitely real and I’m not trying to perpetuate that (I constantly doubt my ability to be successful in CS), it’s important to remember that not everyone can be a D1 athlete, not everyone can be an expert pianist, and not everyone can be a math wizard. Everyone has their own unique gifts and skills, and you shouldn’t be ashamed if CS is not one of those. Rather than constantly shitting on TAs and course structure (because a lot of people do just fine and the TAs often go out of their way to make the course as accessible as possible), maybe reevaluate whether the problem is as severe as you’re making it, or whether you’re just pissed off because you didn’t get seen at hours.\n","date":"Apr 19, 2019, 6:06 PM"},{"content":"5132 - any good resources for APMA 1650?

You guys realize your TAs are also students, right? They've got their own courseloads and a lot have other jobs too, in addition to all of the shit we all have to do as students. Like yeah, TAs are there to help you, and they probably became a TA because they really do want to help you, but at the end of the day, it's a job. Their lives do not revolve around you and your need for help. So asking that TAs hold more hours or offer more support or restructure their courses or reform the entire department is just absurd. And it's got nothing to do with how hard the TAs are working already. They're working hard, but that's not the point. The point is that they are not obligated to work any more than they're already working just because you feel like you deserve more help. So if you're angry about your workload or a perceived lack of support, take it out on the professors for assigning too much work or assigning it all at a bad time. Take it out on the department for not paying TAs enough to get people to take the job. But leave the TAs alone.

I was a couple of seconds into my speech when I suddenly blanked out and stopped speaking, uttering “uh’s” and “um’s” with a visibly worried look. Having felt extremely nervous, I had forgotten my speech. For the five to ten seconds before I resumed (to eventually finish up the speech much more quickly than planned), I didn’t know what to do. I still remember the pitying looks on peoples’ faces.\n\nThat afternoon I went to the library and cried – not because I didn’t get the position but because at that moment I hated myself for my lack of confidence.\n\nNext week could give me the chance to redeem myself or make me embarrass myself once again.

Saying you care about our health is not real concern. Pointing to health and wellness advocates is not real concern. It certainly feels like the department and faculty never truly reflect on what can be done, and how effective current measures are. \n\nMy guess is that large class sizes is the biggest structural barrier.

Are the Pre-Med students who arguably have more work and less support come to Dear Blueno to rant and complain? Are the Physics students? Math or APMA? Computer Science is a SCIENCE, you can only learn the material by putting in the time and effort to sit down and figure it out, You are not expected to know the material instantly, no science expects you to learn the material as soon as it is seen in lecture, it requires time outside of class, whether it be reading the textbook and doing practice problems in Physics and Math, or making flash cards and study guides and models for Bio/Chem, or taking the time to think about your design and try to understand the problem you are given to solve in CS. It takes time, and it seems like a lot of you aren't willing to take the time to learn the material like any other STEM student is and you expect to be fed everything on a silver platter. \n\nEvery department has its issues, every course has its issues, but for you to solely put the blame on the TAs and demand they put in more time just shows the lack of respect you all have for your peers. If you want to see a change, if you have ideas on how a course can be improved, why don't you give constructive criticism and feedback instead of complaining like spoiled brats.

First of all, there are a lot of reasons why they may feel the need to apply anyway outside of the feeling of self-sufficiency: parents who won't just hand them money, parents who stipulate that they need to contribute x amount to the tens of thousands of dollars it costs to go here each year, etc. (these might apply more to upper-middle-class folks than CEO-dad-with-a-yacht folks, but still).\n\nMainly, instead maybe blame companies and institutions that demand that we compete with other students for these awards rather than actually just paying us an amount that is livable and reflects the work that we do!!! I know this type of thing might be hard to implement in certain situations like nonprofits, but this is the actual problem you're experiencing. Some sort of need-based component in the selection process and size of the award is a band-aid fix that Brown could and probably should do to help with this. But the long-term solution can't be that wealthier students don't apply and only lower-income students endure the process of explaining year after year to some committee why the work that they have been hired to do as a qualified, competent college student deserves to be compensated (and admit that their employer doesn't think it does). This just perpetuates unpaid internships as opportunities where the rich kids can always take them, and maaayyybe someone else will get lucky and get outside funding for it! A lot of this is out of Brown's control and will need action in other areas, but there are self-contained things like: can't Brown just give labs some allotment that *must* be used to pay undergrad researchers, instead of making it so that you need to apply for an UTRA (a time consuming, competitive process that is judged by people who might have no experience in the field) to get paid for working in that lab?\n","date":"Apr 16, 2019, 8:42 PM"},{"content":"4970 - yooo, Notre Dame is LIT right now!!

Lecturing should not be their responsibility. It is pretty awful how heavily professors rely so completely on their TAs that they have no idea how their class is being run. I have taken classes where the professor shows up only to lecture, and the TAs make all the homework, deal with all grade complaints, and make all the exams. What the hell is the professor getting paid for, at that point? \n\nHTAs should not be lecturing classes. HTAs should not be overworked and answering 450 piazza questions. We came here to be taught by experts in the field, not by people who took the class once. I'm not saying the TA's aren't fucking brilliant- they're fucking brilliant. TAs have saved my ass numerous times. I am not ignoring the workload that HTA's take on, and the hard work they have put in. I think it's amazing that they are able to do that. But they should not have to be making the class material, grading class material, and now, distributing all class material. \n\nFour student-taught lectures isn't insignificant. That's more than a week's worth of classes. It is a disservice for both the TAs and the students if a professor straight up just plans on giving himself a week off every semester by throwing the work on the HTAs.\n\nIn general, this is a problem with the CS department. We are far too reliant on students to do the teaching here. Professors should not be allowed to just show up to lecture, and check out for the rest of it. Not accusing CS 16's professor of doing this, but certainly agreeing that it has happened more than once to me in this department. \n\ntl;dr The TAs are being exploited for cheap labor by Brown. I'm seriously not trying to hate on TA's or their efforts, but I do think it's important to think about what actions you're really defending here.\n","date":"Apr 16, 2019, 8:42 PM"},{"content":"4967 - Can you take two wintersession courses?

I understand why parent/child incest is wrong because of power dynamics. Also understand why it's problematic to have a child from incest. But in relationships where that dynamic doesn't exist (close-age siblings, cousins, etc.), and not intending to have a child, I've never understood why it's considered wrong.

After all, my father’s already set me up with a job after I graduate that’ll earn me ten times that amount.” Scratching his chin, Ben Deleon offered some advice for low-income students who might be struggling: “Just study harder, you know? Good grades will get you a good job—I mean it worked for me! Once, I had a poor student be my lab partner, and she honestly didn’t pull her weight. Whenever I wanted to meet on short notice, she would always tell me that she couldn’t ‘because she had a shift’.” Deleon then reportedly sighed exasperatedly. “You have to work for your education, like come on people.”\nAs a passerby reminded him of one instance in which he noted that someone without a lot of money still owned something nice, Deleon reportedly grew increasingly irate with the audacity of poor people. “Like, some of them wear really nice clothes, and even look good in them? Um, maybe try saving some money. I mean, most of my clothes are gifts from friends and family.” Deleon then gestured at his outfit composed completel of clothing from Vineyard Vines and Brooks Brothers. \nAt press time, when pressed for an example of low-income students acting irresponsibly, Deleon leaned close to the microphone before confiding, “I’ve even heard that some of them are queer. Honestly, is that even allowed?” \nStay tuned for our follow-up companion piece – “Fiscally conservative area man is aware of systemic economic barriers, but actually just hates poor people”\n\n+++\n\nAs always, thx for reading at plz rate/comment/subscribe - Read my previous stories @ https://www.wattpad.com/story/179958010-dear-blueno-shitposting\n@aubrey – Thank you for your comments about the anti-Semitic tropes used in the other piece.

Stripped of his magical powers, he was left with no choice but to pursue his true calling as a teacher. In particular, a middle school teacher. \nSimilarly, Yoda was in the middle of some intense Jedi meditation when he too was brought to Earth. Luckily for him, because the animals of our world also have mitochondria in our cells, he was able to retain his ability to use to use the force. However, because he was so short, he was forced into the foster system. His bad experiences with different foster parents left a bad taste in his mouth, and he slowly grew to become a tortured soul who really identified with the culture of previous decades and not the shitty modern culture. \nHe didn’t have any high hopes for his new school, though his newest foster parents seemed to be a decent sort. He was always being bullied by other kids for being so short and wrinkly. He made his way to homeroom and dropped his books down onto the ground. Then, the new teacher walked in.\nHis first thought: “OHMIGAWD he is so hot.” The new teacher, who introduced himself by saying, “Many are my names in many countries. Mithrandir among the Elves, Tharkûn to the Dwarves, Olórin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Incánus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go not, but you children of men can call me Gandalf” was an absolutely magnificent specimen of a man. His long, flowing beard was positively sensual. \n“Is he looking at me, or am I just imagining things???”, Yoda wondered to himself. \nBut he wasn’t imagining things! Mr. Gandalf really was. Suddenly, he came up to Yoda’s desk. Yoda’s heart rate shot up and started beating like a Nepalese ceremonial Madal drum. Even more suddenly then before, which was already very sudden, Mr. Gandalf kneeled down. “They call me Mithrandir among the Elves, Tharkûn to the Dwarves, Olórin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Incánus, in the North Gandalf; but for you, you can call me Mac Daddy because I will be your MAC DADDY forever, beautiful.” \nThe other students gasped. They acted as if they were scandalized by the thought of a predatory relationship between a teacher and a middle school student, but they were secretly SO jealous of Yoda. During lunch break, the girls all came up to Yoda.\nRachel, who was always the most popular girl who didn’t talk to Yoda, was suddenly being nice. “WOW Yoda, you’re actually so cute now that I look at you. You’re knobbly green skin is GLOWING, like you have to tell me what your skincare routine is!” \n+++\nok I really can’t bring myself to write more of this, no commentary in this one\nu already know who this is by lmao, check out my wattpad, like follow comment subscribe etc. etc. \n-a\n","date":"Apr 8, 2019, 10:46 AM"},{"content":"4404 - I don't know what I'm doing this summer.

Personally, my sad, poor, low-income status pushes me to find more sustainable/cheaper ways to purchase the same REAL shit y’all do. I’m sorry you don’t shop wisely and need lots and lots of money to look “groomed to perfection.”\n\nF**K your perception of low-income inner city students. Does where we come from mean we can’t dress nicer than you? You honestly sound salty because your low-income inner city friends (who are mostly students of color) probably have a better sense of style than you do. \n\nLastly, I don’t want to speak for everyone but you can keep your “upper class mannerisms.” They are dry as hell and lack flavor and Culture. Oh wait, you can just steal that from us anyway, never mind.\n","date":"Apr 6, 2019, 11:48 AM"},{"content":"4289 - NO ONE USE COLLEGE STORAGE.

I have way more money than a lot of my friends—I was really fortunate to grow up very comfortable. That being said, my family is pretty frugal. I use an iPhone 6, I drive a 12 year old car, and for spring break I was home, not at the beach like so many people here. Meanwhile, the less financial security my friends seem to have, the more they seem to spend. My most financially insecure friend has a new iPhone and is always spending and wanting to Uber places or go out for drinks, not to mention they’ve owed me $100 for about a year now. Is it fair for a low income person to complain about money all the time but also spend all the time? If I’m so wealthy why did your iPhone cost $1000 and mine cost $200? It really bothers me watching this person keep spending, when I know they owe me money and furthermore that once they run out of money, I’m the one who’s going to be buying the bagels they can’t afford. I know this might be an uncouth thing to say with my rich asshole perspective but how am I supposed to want to help my less secure friends when I see them spending so heavily on things I don’t even spend on, like new phones, fancy $200 sneakers, ubers and Caribbean vacations??? I cant help but feel like poor people are just bad with money.

It’s not that being interested in something really specific is wrong (it isn’t). But it shouldn’t be something that people strive for in order to be seen as chic. Like, if you want to be a teacher so you concentrate in education, to me that’s no less cool than someone who studies the intersection of Roman mythology and Chinese folk music. Either course of study is valid and important, but you should study something that you like and that you view as valuable. It shouldn’t be a competition to study the most eccentric and unusual things out there. As others mentioned in the comments on my original post, I’d like to see greater representation on the Brown admissions page. It’s great that some students study these wild and out of the ordinary subjects.

If you see someone you don't know and say \"\"Wow, I find this person really attractive,\"\" that's a judgement you're making before you know anything about their gender identity, so it feels kind of wrong to say attraction is about _gender_ per se.\n\nFor instance, if you're a gay man and you see someone who's \"\"male-presenting\"\" and think that that person is really physically attractive, that would make sense. If you then find out that person identifies as a woman, you don't magically become bisexual; you'd still say you were gay. If you agree with that, then it seems like you agree that sexuality isn’t about what _gender(s)_ you’re attracted to.\n\nAlso, truthfully, somebody saying something like \"\"I'm 100% gay\"\" seems totally fine to me, but saying something like \"\"I'd never hook up with someone who used she/her/hers pronouns,\"\" feels a bit skeezy. Similarly saying something like \"\"I'd never date or hook up with a non-binary person,\"\" feels pretty gross regardless of your sexuality, which makes me feel like sexuality doesn't really revolve around gender. (I'm writing this after reading post 3978 -- OP seemed straight, imo, because being down to hookup with NB people doesn't feel like an identity, it feels like just not being shitty). \n\nBut basically, in general, it feels like defining who you're attracted to completely on how much they adhere to some specific gender norms is just kinda gross, and it'd be a bit more honest if we said who you're attracted to is mostly just about physical appearance.\n\nThoughts?\n","date":"Apr 3, 2019, 9:28 AM"},{"content":"4137 - Why does the shiru manager take up four seats when clearly people are looking for places to sit down???\n","date":"Apr 3, 2019, 9:28 AM"},{"content":"4136 - Hi!

Isn't a part of why we pay so much money for a private school such as Brown for ability to receive assistance in securing a high-paying job? As we just saw with the recent admissions cycle, getting into Brown is super competitive, and students should have equal opportunities to the work they put in (which is a lot for getting into Brown). But if we compare to other schools (https://www.timeshighereducation.com/rankings/united-states/2019#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats), we see that Brown's average salary is significantly lower.\n\nSome reasons the article cites includes our emphasis on working at non-profits and lack of our involvement in finance/consulting. However, in recent years, Brown's interest in CS and Econ has exploded, and I wouldn't suspect this to be the case anymore. \n\nFurthermore, I've seen a lot of posts on Dear Blueno about people being rejected from multiple jobs, especially at high-paying jobs at Goldman, JP Morgan, Google, Amazon, Morgan Stanley, Bain, etc. Is Brown losing its name value in the corporate world?

She came along and laughed, and then berated me for my \"\" attitude\"\" towards her on the elevator ride up because she's not satisfied unless I have a stiff, submissive smile she fixes towards men way too young for her to reassure herself that she's still attractive ( haha she's not- should have developed that brain while your looks were still kicking you perfect little housewife- not!)\n\nI actually hope my dad is cheating on her and/ or will divorce her soon. I would welcome any new stepmother, save for any criminal/ danger to me tendencies. Literally, even if somehow this new stepmother's arrival correlates with my dad refusing to pay college funds- whatever, I'll be an independent. I'd pay my entire tuition five times over to spend one less day with her in my presence.\n\nShe just unleashed a monster in me- a little part of a woman's soul is destroyed every time such atrocities by men are ignored and laughed off. She is worse than the patriarchy because she is a vehicle that not only enables it, but cries \"\" More, More!\"\" \n\nBut I am torn, I am resilient, and I can be stone cold. From this point forward, every interaction with her will be for ME, not her. I haven't had love for her in a long time, and FUCK the institution of marriage if that is what is keeping my dad from financially cutting her off. Doesn't pull her own weight- can't function in the workplace- can't even carry out basic tasks- just sits around and criticizes. She's the worst taker I have ever met. I am ashamed to be her daughter. \n\nFrom this point forward, everything I do will be to embarrass her. She wants me to have a respectable career- haha I'll find my way on to TMZ. She wants me to be a nice person and find \"\" respectable friend\"\"- boo hoo Tinder's going to have to create a second app for me. She wants me to live close to home- California here I come. \n\nI write this as a pre- apology to the people in my life, but mostly my twisted family ( dad, I have some good divorce lawyers). Sorry, but any day now I'm just going to disappear from your life. No, not suicide- you could never do that to me. But you're going to call my number and hear the automated voice saying that the number is no longer in service. You're going to get a note from some lawyers saying that if you ever open up a credit card under my social security information you'll find your ass in jail faster than you can give my that twisted smile that I always had to deal with whenever I fell down or failed at a subject. You'll come to Brown, scouring the campus. Maybe you'll find me maybe you won't- gap years are a thing (that you hate, so all the better). If you do, come one step too close and you'll meet some nice guys (at least I think so) from DPS. I will do everything in my goddamm power to succeed, and gain money and power YOU could only dream of. \n\nI cannot believe I am related to such a repulsive human being. The person who threatened to throw me out for racking up a 10 cent library fine I was going to pay off with my lunch money. The person who picked up her friend's kids from school and when she saw that there was no space for me, just had them close the doors and drive away, coming back three hours later, slapping me for not greeting you properly. We live so close to Detroit, yet even in some of the most dysfunctional families I've lived with when your abuse became too much, I at least sensed at least a smudge of love, or if it wasn't love, at least fondness, or an urge to protect. I never got that with you. When you almost drove our car off a bridge and yelled at me- saying \"\" all the things I do for you.\"\" When my friends would accuse me of things that I didn't do and you would make me write public notes of apology to them and their moms. When you would never get what any of my teachers are saying, whether they say it in English or YOUR NATIVE LANGUAGE FOR GOD\"\"S SAKE and they would generally start to avoid situations where they would be stuck with you, and by extension me. When you would force me to come home for spring break as a way to distract yourself from your failing marriage. \n\nThe thought of money is the only thing that makes me happy. And the hardest thing for society to do is to sympathize with someone who loves money. But why should I seek the love of society? I've never been loved in my entire life and I don't have to start now. Money is what's going to pay for those plastic surgeries that will erase any trace of you from my face and body. Money is what's going to pay for a house, with food and clothes, far away from you. Money is what's going to make me realize one day that I CAN BUY AND SELL YOU. And I'll remind you of that every day. \n\nMom, I hope you live forever. Because you've become, in a sick way, my sole motivation for everything I do. Whether it's advancing a startup or getting on with the job search, every step of the way, you will see what you're missing. And if you don't understand, don't worry- letters sprayed with Chanel No. 5 and sealed with a YSL lipstick smudge will do it. You will regret the day you crossed me for a final time. You are the reason I can't love, can't respect, can't trust. But I'll be dammed if I don't let that bite you in the ass over, and over, and over again. \n\nTo the Brown community, I come to you because you are the first place where I met people that were nice to me. I'm sorry- I really am- if I become a person that would make admissions and you all think- that's not the person we thought we admitted, that's not a person I would want to know went to my alma mater. I'm sorry, but I can't live up to this community's expectations of goodness, community service, and most importantly, empathy. I'm not a good person- but I don't delude myself into thinking I am one, unlike my mother. I'm cruel, I'm selfish, I'm materialistic, and when somebody acts in a way that reminds me of my mother- they wake up to a nightmare. Most of all, I'm sorry if you guys one day wake up and perhaps remember me, probably living in recluse in some country or another, and realize that the things I will do- career or personal life wise, which caused so much pain to other people all began with one root- my solo quest to destroy every once of reputation my mother has tried to build up. \n\nSincerely,\nMiss Apathetic\n","date":"Mar 31, 2019, 8:38 AM"},{"content":"4052 - cw: israel\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n@3953 (https://www.facebook.com/dearblueno/posts/662273750882837): You might want to learn more about Israeli politics!

For parental income, some may be from a city with higher living expenses or come from divorced/ separated families circumstances where one parent's income never reaches them. With a big house, they may be from a rural area where larger houses, less renovated houses are less expensive.

I also feel like a lot of people here are using the word Zionism incorrectly, and leading to some very problematic statements. \n\nZionism is defined as \"\"a movement for (originally) the re-establishment and (now) the development and protection of a Jewish nation in what is now Israel\"\", however going beyond that, it can be defined as supporting \"\"Jewish self-determination\"\". Now for a myriad of reasons, historically Zionism was focused on establishing a Jewish homeland in the area that was Ottoman controlled Palestine, which later became British Controlled Palestine. Some of these reasons were because it was where the historic Kingdom of Israel was from around 1,000-200 BCE, because the British promised they would give that area to Jews, there was already a large Jewish population there, but that's just some of it. \n\nLogically after the UN established Israel as a 'Jewish State' Zionism has focused on that region, that said though, Zionism does not necessarily mean supporting a Jewish state in that region, or annexing the West Bank and Gaza. There had been movements to establish the state in Europe, Africa, and even Australia. The US even debated on creating a state in Alaska, but it was vetoed by the Alaskan government. There are a ton of reasons the UN put the state where they did, like those mentioned above, some logical, like that Jews didn't feel safe with a state in Europe because of the Holocaust, there were already a million Jewish refugees there, and some less logical, and more based around religious fundamentalism and nationalism. \n\n!!! However this is the most important bit, and if you are going to read any of this PLEASE READ THIS. !!!\n\nZionism does not mean supporting the actions of the current government, or any of the past governments of Israel. Zionism is for the vast majority of Jews not a form of hardcore Jewish nationalism, or the desire for a Jewish only state. Zionism to most Jews is believing that since Juadism is a distinct cultural group they have a right to Self-Determination, and the creation, and continuation of a state, a la, South Sudan, Czech Republic, and India. Zionism is the same type of belief as supporting independence in Kosovo, Hong Kong, Kurdistan, Navajo Territories, and Palestine. It is also the believe that Jews aren't safe in a country that is not at least based around Jewish morals and cultures (which does not mean Jewish only), as they have faced genocide from many statues through out history. \n\nThat doesn't mean that Israel's expansionist policies are okay, or Divestment is inherently bad, or the rights for a Jewish state come before the rights for a Palestinian state, but I am sick of hearing Zionism talked about like it is a far right racist belief. And yes, not all Jews are Zionist, and not all Zionists are Jews, and being anti-Israel is not the same as being Anti-Zionist. However while some Jews here might disagree with me, and that's fine, I, and many others, believe anti-Zionism is in almost all cases anti-Semitic. Unless you are some sort of strict Anarchist or extreme Neo-Liberal who is opposed to states existing period, being Anti-Zionist means you are against Jews having self determination, which is in itself as problematic as saying any other minority group doesn't have a right to govern itself.\n","date":"Mar 28, 2019, 5:01 PM"},{"content":"3974 - how to stay in chicago for cheap over the summer?\n","date":"Mar 28, 2019, 5:01 PM"},{"content":"3973 - chances of getting a link award as a freshman?\n","date":"Mar 28, 2019, 5:01 PM"},{"content":"3972 - You introduced me to new music that I like almost as much as I liked you.

Given that Jews have been persecuted more than pretty much any other religion, they deserve a safe haven that belongs to them and that is not controlled by some oppressive majority. On campus, we have organizations and clubs dedicated to supporting marginalized groups. Someone could argue “it’s not fair to have a computer science club that’s only for people of color.” But given that people of color have been disadvantaged in the field, they deserve to have their own space to come together and surmount systematic obstacles. Obviously Israel is more complex than that, because there were people living on the land before refugees arrived from Europe. But the importance of having a Jewish safe haven remains. That’s why many Jews feel threatened by anti-Israel rhetoric.

And part of her already does that but she’s still a teen so I think there’s hope for her. \n\nI know my parents want me to preferably marry someone like me but I pointed her out and they said if she acted well enough they might be inclined to consider it.

However I feel like the debate around Israel that has been happening around Brown is very much focused on Israel as a state being inherently bad, and that it shouldn't exist. This debate leads into a lot of murky areas, and in the end I think it sows division and will just lead to nothing happening, as shown with CPax. I feel like instead of focusing on Israel as a nation, the focus should be on Benjamin Netanyahu and the Likud party, especially since the Israeli elections are coming up soon. That's not to say that all the issues of Israel are limited to Netanyahu and his party, but they are by far the biggest force in human rights violations in the nation. Calling for Israelis at Brown, or people who know Israelis, to vote against him, and spreading information about his government, and the alternatives to it will be more effective at providing a path for peace. Calling for something as drastic as Israel's complete restructuring or removal not just leads to no changes as it is such a drastic goal, but also comes off as threatening to Israel's distinct culture, and to many Israelis and Jews at Brown. Targeting the right wing government on the other hand is a lot more digestible. I think who Israel elects shows a lot about its nation, but also the majority of people in Israel don't support Likud, and therefore we can't blame the whole country.\n\nCalling for Israel to not exist is like saying that America should not exist because of the atrocities Trump and the Republicans have committed, or China shouldn't exist because of Xi Jinping and its treatment of the Uyghur population.\n","date":"Mar 27, 2019, 8:45 AM"},{"content":"3952 - Tbh I’ll do heroine during spring weekend\n","date":"Mar 27, 2019, 8:44 AM"},{"content":"3951 - For a lot of white people in this country, this Mueller Report was eye-opening because it was the first time they felt what it’s like to call the cops on some bullshit and having absolutely nothing happen.

I didn't mean to sound like an insensitive spoiled brat, but I definitely came across that way.\n\nI don't mean to sound classist, but reporting a person like my dad ( who owns a Pharma firm) to a domestic violence help site is not how it works in our circles. He has enough money and power- aka he plays golf with local judges, went to college with some of the East Coast's best lawyers, can easily shell out $300k in hush money to the right people for things like this to go away. And what would happen if I did report him- he would scare my stepmom( who has a pathological fear of abandonment and no family/ career to go back to) into backing him up. He would find out who reported him- doesn't have to look far, and then boom I'm on the streets and can no longer pay tuition or use my allowance money to help my mom settle some of her debts. \n\nI don't really know why he would go for a nineteen year old when he's always been obsessed with prestige. He always brags about his Ivy League degree and my mom had gone to a \"\" public ivy\"\" and finished top of her class- had a job lined up in a prestigious marketing firm when she gave in and accepted his proposal. At least 3/4 of all the wives in their circle also had near Ivy degrees and had extensive knowledge of fine art, etiquette, or ran small businesses for themselves. Meanwhile, all my stepmom knows how to do is wait tables- and I guess it disgusts me that he met her when she served him and my mom during their anniversary. So basically he started cheating on my mom during one of the most cherished days for her. From day one, he stopped giving gifts to my mom while gifting her Hermes Birkins, Canada goose jackets ( because she saw that's what people her age were wearing), and a G Wagon. \n\nIt's hard not to see her as a catalyst for weird things my dad began doing. For example, when she moved in, he hit a maid for not folding her clothes right and when my stepmom cried he hugged her and said the maid hated her for breaking up this marriage, and that he could have anyone but he loves her most. From that point on, she became so paranoid that she wouldn't even give the maid( who was the same socioeconomic class my stepmom was before she met my dad), eye contact even when the maid even said TO ME that she was more sympathetic of the nineteen year old than anything. In the end, an employee of my family who was like an aunt ended up being fired by my dad. \n\nI'm also worried that she might use a baby to establish herself socioeconomically. I don't know the full story but when I'm trying to do work in secluded spots in my house, I often find open birth control items hidden. When I confront her, she seems confused and shows me an identical bottle of pills she says she keeps in the bathroom she and my father share. Then my dad threatens to kick me out when she tells him about our conversation. Also, when I'm home either I or our driver has to take her everywhere because my dad says she's a reckless driver. That puts me in the uncomfortable position because she often asks me to take her to the local community college to visit her friends- who my dad says are druggies and don't fit in with our culture. Once I had my allowance taken away for helping her find where my dad took her license. \n\nWith stuff like the Granoff dinners, I have to say there are certain etiquettes that comes naturally to children of the rich and watching my stepmom try to fit in with people is what I'd guess outsiders would feel if they had to enter these enclaves of classism. So I do sympathize with her for that. The conversations that revolve around business fly over her head and when she meets my mom's friends she doesn't really make an effort to speak to them. \n\nI think the worst part is that she's becoming my dad's dream girl and did nothing to deserve it. He offered to give her funds for a charity dinner, but that's about the only contribution that can be linked to her. She doesn't work and spends her days telling my dad every detail of her life. For example, even when they got married, she had an anxiety attack and my dad ended up choosing her dress. She dresses in a way where each outfit costs around her former monthly salary and sometimes she can be really entitled to salespeople and waiters, especially when my dad's around.\n","date":"Mar 24, 2019, 9:02 PM"},{"content":"3910 - Are you an overachieving perfectionist?

But if we can understand why people feel uncomfortable with certain strategies, we can figure out what parts of their concerns are rational, are historically rooted, etc, and which fears are the product of misinformation and political and media manipulation. I see that anger has a huge role in certain campaigns. And anger is important. Recognizing your anger is really important. Expressing that anger can be important. But rarely will anger alone convince someone else of your worldview. It's useful to tap into other emotions. And if we look into this question sociologically, we see that people tend to dig their heels in deeper when they feel attacked. We see this with so many issues. So for instance, you will not convince someone who doesn't believe in climate change that climate change exists by yelling at them that it exists. You can convince them that renewable energy offers an incredible economic opportunity. Think about, where possible, we can unite with people who we are divided from. It will be easier to get to where we want to go if we have fewer people against us. I would argue that by listening for the best in people, especially in people where it would be easier to simplify them as bad people, we can find better strategies for change making. This is not a message to quell righteous anger but rather a suggestion in how we can be more effective and a message to implore people to recognize that we will also need love, hope, kindness, and other feminizing strategies to win peace and justice on earth. And this is something I think our campus deeply needs to consider right now.\n","date":"Mar 24, 2019, 8:59 PM"},{"content":"3885 - I know it’s weird that I’m a first-gen (my entire family is uneducated) and also a philosophy major currently focusing on epicureanism (partially a renegade tbh) — but sometimes I get frustrated trying to communicate my knowledge while they nod in confusion\n","date":"Mar 24, 2019, 8:59 PM"},{"content":"3884 - HELP how does one finish up coding AND crypto assignments and get them over with while also being on a mandatory trip abroad and is deeply, irrevocably distracted by the wonders of Foreign Culture?\n","date":"Mar 24, 2019, 8:58 PM"},{"content":"3883 - But If you loved me\nWhy did you leave me\nTake my body\nTake my body\n","date":"Mar 24, 2019, 8:58 PM"},{"content":"3882 - I’m super pumped about joining a band with people who are into the same music, but I’ve never really played intricate stuff before (they specialize in jazz scales/modal harmony/RealBook stuff and although I’ve only touched on maj/min/basic pentatonic, I have perfect pitch and a great ear for improv even without knowing all the theory yet).

It proceeded to ethnically cleanse the Arab population and send colonists from Israel in preparation for annexation in 1981. The Druze community was allowed to stay, but they have since refused Israeli citizenship and call for the territory to be returned to Syria.\n\nThe United States is now the first country to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan, despite it violating international law against ethnic cleansing, annexation through conquest, and the principle of self-determination (for the remaining Syrian majority). Is this the feared double standard against Israel? Is there any other country the United States has made similar accommodations for?\n\nThe news this week shows why our Divest vote was so important. Israel will not provide justice for the Palestinians on its own, and it has no incentive to if the United States continues to coddle Israel like it did in recognizing Jerusalem as its capital last year. There needs to be a major shift in the way the United States treats Israel, and that can only be accomplished through a grassroots political movement like this.\n\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/1.5091555?v=70C9FD6218C6736AFE111DEEC9ED3FE2\nUpdated Mar 24, 2019, 8:57 PM\n","date":"Mar 24, 2019, 8:57 PM"},{"content":"3873 - cw: israel/palestine\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nTo those of you who are posting articles of Palestine attacking Israel as some sort of, \"\"See? Israel isn't the only one attacking! It's defense against the Palestinians!\"\" -- shame on you. We need to stop pretending as though Israel, with one of the strongest militaries in the WORLD, is only a victim to the big bad in Palestine. Palestine is an extremely weak group compared to Israel, and without pressure to stop occupying Palestine, the country will never, ever have to give in to a two-state solution or otherwise. Should there be missiles thrown into Israel? No, but these attacks are almost always unsuccessful and do not justify the level of retaliation (which causes many injuries and deaths). Moreover, other than fighting of this sort, Palestinians live in fear of military rule, not having enough medicine, not getting enough food, not being able to access clean water, not being able to move around freely - it's a vicious, vicious cycle to say that they throw rocks or bombs because they just hate all Jews, so Israel fires it right back; this all just creates room for more hate. \n\nAll of you who say no, let us not pressure Israel or make a statement that this is not okay through divesting from companies that are complicit in human rights abuses there because we need a \"\"two-state solution\"\" are really meaning, let us force an agreement that is only going to truly favor Israel. There should be a two-state solution, but without anyone having Palestine's interests remotely on our radar, it will not be even close to a fair agreement. I have met no one pro-divestment who believes that Israel should not exist, and that there should be a one-state solution - just because there is a call to stop the horrendous things Israel can do, does not mean that everyone hates Jews and wants to take Israel away.\n\nI don't know how you can pretend as if Israel is doing nothing wrong, and that nothing needs to be done to protect Palestinians.

Do you think that every student that voted on this issue took the time to sit down and thoroughly reflect on the deeply rooted effects divestment would bring about? Do you think that political propaganda around this campus (and even the way the referendum was phrased) didn’t play a role in the responses obtained? Do you even think that the vote was representative considering only <20% of Brown students actually voted for divestment? There are highly experienced people working at Brown specifically to determine what is best for the university and, whether you like it or not, maintaining a profitable investments portfolio and Granoff dinners are BOTH things that Brown (and we as its students) are highly benefitted by. Divesting would not even impact the corresponding companies, it would only impact us, and it is undoubtedly a dumb move that I am glad Brown didn’t just subserviently bow down to. You might think you know it all and that the world is yours because at Brown you feel indestructible with your ideologies, but the truth is that the real world is something completely different. Stop feeding your own ego thinking you are doing the world a favor with your obsessive paranoia revolving ethics and start considering the practical effects certain actions may bring about.

A shit load of money will always be a political instrument. What happens on this campus will always be expressing political views.\n2) \"\"Its role is not to take sides on contested geopolitical issues\"\" and \"\"I have been steadfast in my view that Brown should not embrace any of the planks of the BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanctions) movement\"\" are directly oppositional statements. Not allowing BDS and not listening to voices demanding divestment ARE political acts in themselves. Choosing to not do anything as the president of this university is a political act. You can't change that just because you say so. \n3) This was not about an academic boycott, so I don't know why you're bringing that up. But, because you did, I'd like to point out that the fact that you \"\"made it clear that Brown would not support academic boycotts of Israel or any other country\"\" is actually just false. How would you feel about advancing our knowledge on the benefits of slave labor in North Korea? This is not to say that the two nations or their actions are equivalent, but the principle in itself is flawed and, quite frankly, a lie. \n4) I cannot stress this enough – your decision to immediately shoot this down is a political action no matter how much acrobatics you perform to try to make it seem like its not. Students walk around this campus that have been directly harmed by the violence in Israel/Palestine knowing that their tuition money continues to fund instruments of violence there. Let's be real, 69% is not a polarized campus, the poles just shifted a direction you (and certain members of the board of trustees) don't like. To pretend like the concern here is a polarization of the campus is to cover up that you are really concerned about polarizing our donors and completely disregarding the experiences of students who already feel excluded and unheard on this campus due to your inaction. \n\nBy your logic, if 27.5% of undergraduate students support divestment, then only 12% of the undergraduate population opposes divestment. If you are going to disregard student voices to stand with them, you will need to answer to this community with the bravery and responsibility that this conflict requires, not a half-assed and cowardly email.\n","date":"Mar 22, 2019, 10:07 PM"},{"content":"3826 - Every time someone likes me I find out later that they have Yellow Fever lmfao I love my Exotic Ethnicity being my only desirable trait\n","date":"Mar 22, 2019, 2:01 PM"},{"content":"3828 - cw: divest\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nIs anyone who voted no conflicted over how they should feel about the margin (69%)?\n","date":"Mar 22, 2019, 1:52 PM"},{"content":"3827 - cw: divest\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nportion of students: outraged over $3b institution’s policy, many of whom wouldn't even be \"\"outraged\"\" if it weren't a hot buzz topic\n$3b institution: doesn’t change policy\nstudents: *pikachu face*\n","date":"Mar 22, 2019, 1:51 PM"},{"content":"3825 - what was the cutoff for an A in APMA 1650 last semester?\n","date":"Mar 22, 2019, 1:51 PM"},{"content":"3824 - cw: divest\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI'm reading CPax's email and wondering how Brown Divest could've forgotten about the Electoral College–they needed to campaign in Wisconsin!\n","date":"Mar 22, 2019, 1:51 PM"},{"content":"3823 - What did you think was gonna happen?\n","date":"Mar 22, 2019, 1:51 PM"},{"content":"3822 - cw: divest\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nI’m so disappointed in C Pac right now.\n","date":"Mar 22, 2019, 1:51 PM"},{"content":"3821 - cw: divest\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nDivest is NOT a political stance, it is a HUMANITARIAN one!\n","date":"Mar 22, 2019, 1:50 PM"},{"content":"3820 - cw: divest\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\"\"Brown’s endowment is not a political instrument to be used to express views on complex social and political issues, especially those over which thoughtful and intelligent people vehemently disagree.

The 19 year old acts like a effing kid and I’m a senior while she would be a sophomore. She keeps trying to buy me with Cartier, Chanel, and maybe even champagne..... oh wait... she can’t drink yet. MY BAD.\n\nMy mom who’s not bad for 45 feels old even though she’s 3 years younger than my dad. My dad screwed her in the divorce and she has trouble getting back in the workforce. How can one go from being with a college sweetheart to being practically on the streets? \n\nMy dad’s so controlling and the kid he married was a waitress when they met and worships him in a way that he doesn’t deserve to be. He goes everywhere with her and touches her inappropriately in public, furthering embarrassing my mom. \n\nShe’s the type that is bratty when you let her be but cowers and apologizes when you raise your voice at her. She keeps trying to be buddy buddy with me and asks about getting in to college and whether I knew a good way to do so without angering my dad- he hit her when she asked the last time, but typical dad- took her on a shopping spree and promised not to do it again. \n\nThe worst part is that I feel like she replaces me as a daughter more than she replaces my mom as a wife. And that makes me feel inadequate- I thought even my dad would have been proud to have raised a strong feminist woman but he forsakes me for someone who can barely hold a conversation. \n\nI think he’s disappointed I want to go to med school instead of business- and every time my stepmom says she wants to be a nurse he just offers to fund a fashion boutique for her to work part time in. I also dress pretty inconspicuously and he makes her change into the 2,000+ ensembles he buys for her.\n\nI have strong political beliefs. Meanwhile when his friends come over his new wife doesn’t contribute to conversations or he interrupts her and speaks for her. I always thought of his friends as uncles but they seem very bemused with my dad’s new wife and welcome her presence. \n\nWeeks at home are like hell- I have to deal with the fallout of my dad scolding her or giving her the third degree in order to get her to admit something. Apparently she was quite a prankster in high school- also known as like a year ago. Now she just likes to joke around and my dad finds it amusing one day but the next says he has to punish her. She then cries and then he hugs her and the cycle is reborn bla bla. \n\nThere was never so much drama when my mom’s around- now I can’t even live with her because she’s so offset with legal fees. But she supported him and kept us together the best she could- she never argued, always had everything domestic settled, and was a great host for his business partners. Why he would leave her for a woman who he’s always explaining simple stuff to- I’ll never understand.\n","date":"Mar 22, 2019, 1:48 PM"},{"content":"3812 - sometimes i write bbas about people just to see their happiness in the comments\n","date":"Mar 22, 2019, 1:48 PM"},{"content":"3811 - Is it possible to get permission to take 6 credits in a semester?\n","date":"Mar 22, 2019, 1:48 PM"},{"content":"3810 - cw: divest\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n“Woohoo!

The gist was that this person was uncomfortable having to pay to see her perform at \"\"an ivy league's private concert\"\" given that this person had seen her perform for free a few years ago at another school. I'm not a musician myself, but being close to a lot of musicians, I have seen how infuriating It can be when people expect that you'll play for free, especially when artists have historically been paid at the same event. If this person is suggesting Brown pay her and just front the cost so that students don't have to pay, where does this person think the money is coming from? If Brown pays Mitski, then Brown would have to pay for all of the other artists coming too. The money has to be taken from somewhere, and I doubt it'll come from where you want it to. and tbh paying $20 for a spring weekend ticket is super reasonable compared to other concerts.

Often, I wait to eat until I feel deliriously hungry, and, if I do eat, I stuff myself until I feel really bloated. A few times, I've gone so long without eating that I've struggled to breath/stand up. Tonight, after I struggled to do homework, I tried to make myself throw up because I wanted to punish myself for not working fast enough. Although I didn't succeed, I'm still really concerned that I tried to do that, especially since I have a history of self-harm.\n\nI never struggled with eating before this semester and I feel confused as to why I'm struggling with it right now. I also don't know if what I'm experiencing is \"\"bad enough\"\" to be worried about, or is me just making too big of a deal out nothing. \n\nI was wondering if anyone had any advice for how to handle eating difficulties?

However these same groups actively disparage white people, the administration, and any concept of \"\"authority\"\" or \"\"oppressor\"\" without a second thought.

I don't get how people can say that the Spring Weekend lineup is even in the same stratosphere as it has been in years past. Even if Daniel Casear and Amine are your favorite artists, you have to understand that the majority of the student population likes 2-4 songs (that's being generous) from both of those artists. Just as an example, in 2010 we got very good artists in almost every single major genre, and I can say with certainty that the majority of the student population fucked heavy with AT LEAST one of the artists. During that year, MGMT, The Black Keys, Major Lazer, Wale AND Snoop Dogg were all included. There was something for everyone. Instead of trying to appeal to a few people who are excited to get blackout for Daniel Caesar's slow ass music (i would actually consider myself a Daniel Caeser fan, don't get me wrong, its just not a concert vibe), can you please try to get more artists that everyone can enjoy?

As someone who has always lived in America and was raised Catholic, I've made a lot of efforts in the past couple weeks to understand the issue better, and I have found what I consider to be valid reasons to call for divestment as well as many thoughtful and important critiques of divestment. Among those arguments, good people on both sides of the divest issue seem to genuinely believe they are supporting what is right. I know this isn't a hot take, but I feel it is really important context for the result of the referendum.\n\nThere has also unfortunately been a lot of anger over this, a lot of it on Dear Blueno, and I know these are really personal and important issues for many different reasons and I don't want to trivialize the very real reasons people have to feel hurt. However, I think when the results come out on Thursday, everyone should keep in mind that though there are bigoted people in the student body and people that have intrinsic biases on the issue, many of us are coming together in good faith to have this conversation and voting for the right reasons rather than the wrong ones, i.e. voting \"\"yes\"\" because they support Palestinian rights and ethical investments and not because they want to destroy Israel or condemn Jews, or voting \"\"no\"\" because they don't feel that divestment is the most responsible way for Brown to approach the situation and not because they don't care about the suffering of Palestinians. I really worry that a lot of the productive dialogue that's been happening will get lost after the voting and that any result will leave some students feeling that their voices weren't heard or weren't regarded as important. So regardless of the outcome, we all should work to make sure Muslims and Jews feel safe and welcome in our Brown community, and also to pressure Brown to invest transparently and in ways that improve rather than hinder human rights around the world.\n","date":"Mar 20, 2019, 5:35 PM"},{"content":"3671 - cw: spring weekend lineup\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nIf you don’t know any of the spring weekend artists, you’ve been living under a rock.

Dear Blueno Admins here. Hope you missed us 🙂 \n\nWe've been thinking long and hard about what we want Dear Blueno to become in the future, as well as how it has operated as a public anonymous forum in the past. We’ve also been listening and taking note of what y’all as a community have requested this page to be more aware of and to handle more appropriately, through DMs and submitted posts.\n\nWe as the admins have received a lot of feedback that that the platform has generally become a cesspool for negativity and generally Bad Takes. We agree — there comes a point where free speech begins to give way to hate speech, and it has reached a point that we feel that changes need to be made in the way we run this page.\n\nTo that end, we've decided to begin taking a heavier stance on moderation, and will begin to make the distinction between posts that generate negative impact as opposed to productive conversation. From here on forward, we will choose not to post submissions that are repetitions of approved posts (e.g. “circumcision is [insert opinion here]”), as well as submissions that would generate negativity within the community (e.g. “i don’t believe learning disabilities are real”). We will continue to post submissions that seem to have been submitted out of genuine ignorance and/or good faith (e.g. “why would people with SEAS accommodations want to live off campus?”).\n\nBecause this is so sudden, we will be posting all the submissions that we would ordinarily have posted today. Tomorrow, we will begin our new moderation strategy. \n\nP.S. Please note that there will always be posts that we can’t predict the impact of, and posts that will generate unexpected hostility within the community. With that in mind, don’t hesitate to DM us if you feel something doesn’t have a place on the page. \n\nWith Love, \nDear Blueno\n","date":"Mar 20, 2019, 7:36 AM"},{"content":"3603 - when does the spring weekend lineup come out?\n","date":"Mar 19, 2019, 6:43 PM"},{"content":"3602 - okay but this is more important than hogwarts houses\nLIKE for non-bender\nHEART for I don't watch avatar I only watch Japanese Cartoons\nWOW for airbender\nLAUGH for earthbender\nSAD for waterbender\nANGRY for firebender\n","date":"Mar 19, 2019, 6:42 PM"},{"content":"3601 - WHERE ARE MY CANTO PEEPS\n","date":"Mar 19, 2019, 6:42 PM"},{"content":"3600 - Sometimes when I'm scrolling through Dear Blueno, I really, really wish there was a ? react.\n","date":"Mar 19, 2019, 6:42 PM"},{"content":"3599 - cw: divest\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nIt is evident that Divest will greatly risk our endowment, especially the financial aid.

I don't want to start a fight. This is out of real curiosity. I couldn't find anything about this on their website. \n\nBDH published an article today from the staff of the school's investment office detailing why divesting from specific companies isn't feasible without compromising the future income of the school. But going beyond that, many of the companies that Brown Divest specifically mentions (Caterpillar, HP, Motorola, Boeing, Textron) are huge corporations that are in every US broad market index fund as well as the S&P 500. The smaller companies, if publicly traded, would possibly be in the broad market fund. In fact, if you look at Boeing's top 10 major stock holders, 5 of them are S&P 500 or broad stock market index funds. \n\nYour future retirement accounts and 401(k)s, your parents' college fund, and portions of Brown's investments (which funds 18% of annual operation from professor salary to financial aid) etc. all rely on these low-cost index funds to have gains on investment with low fees. They are large enough companies that they are the measure of the US' economy, making them companies that countless people depend upon for reliable investment returns. I'm not talking about wall street snakes raking up billions of dollars; I'm talking about your ordinary middle class family who has some retirement savings in a 401(k) or a pension fund through the company at which they work. I'm talking about us in a few years when we (should) have retirement accounts saving as little or as much as we can. \n\nFirst, let's assume that the portfolio managers Brown hires are now contractually obligated to not invest in these companies. Brown still holds index funds that owns these companies. Sure, it's completely fair to criticize these companies' specific actions in selling equipment to the IDF and other such organizations. But these companies do other things than sell products to the IDF. (Caterpillar construction equipment? HP printers?) \n\nLong winded background to my question: I want to know whether the goal of the Divest movement is to completely eliminate these companies from index funds? From all retirement funds?\n\nWow this sounds like a loaded question, but it is a genuine question that I have. If that is your goal, I respect your dedication to your cause and wish you the best of luck. But if not, I don't think it is a consistent argument. \n\n(I'm not some BEO finance bro that's trying to flex his Investments class knowledge. I'm just another student whose parents have a retirement account, which surely contains index funds, and whose tuition is being paid substantially through the gains from these index funds.)\n","date":"Mar 19, 2019, 5:58 PM"},{"content":"3537 - I hope the dear blueno admins are alright.

Examples of this include not one instance of words accusing the other side or Israel of \"\"hate\"\" or evil. I've seen the \"\"No campaign\"\" shared with the messages of against \"\"hate\"\" and \"\"discrimination\"\" when it clearly seems to me that this is not what the Brown's Divestment campaign espouses. Not only this, but the inclusiveness of Brown Divest reaches out to many students of many backgrounds, receiving support from Palestinians, Jews, and others alike. I've not seen this with BSI's campaign, and after hearing the previous Dear Blueno post criticizing the \"\"No to Brown Divest\"\" on its use of Arabic and the Palestinian flag despite no perceived representation of any Palestinians, have come to the conclusion that a more diversified pool of students support Brown Divest and that it was inappropriate for BSI to have included this image on the cover pages of its event.

You CANNOT tell a group that has been so seriously oppressed for centuries what is it is not anti-Semitic. That is our narrative to claim. Whenever you roll your eyes and claim that BDS isn’t anti-Semitic, you are dismissing and ignoring the very valid and real feelings of Jewish students. We are allowed to dictate how we feel and if we feel targeted. If we feel that BDS is anti-Semitic, then that’s our narrative to construct. I DONT care “how many times you have had to explain that BDS isn’t anti-Semitic.” It doesn’t make it true; especially when it comes from the voices of students who are not Jewish, who did not have grandparents who had to endure the most traumatizing of horrors in the holocaust, who do not have to hide their identity when traveling to other countries out of fear of being killed. You can’t tell another group how it feels or whether it’s being oppressed—that is not righteous.\n\nAs a Jewish student, BDS makes ME feel targeted. I admit that I do not agree with the Israeli government at the moment, but all countries need work. The Israeli government is being unfairly targeted. At the end of the day you cannot separate Israel form Jews; Israel stands up for the Jews and provides a home for the Jews when we are alienated, oppressed, and killed by almost every other country in the world. To be against Israel, is to be against Jews having a home of safety and peace. And that is how I feel as a Jew—and you cannot tell me my feelings are wrong.

My friends had warned me against taking this course, and a 2.89 on the Critical Review was not reassuring, but I was overconfident and thought to myself: \"\"oh, how bad could it be.\"\"\n\nHow bad could it be indeed.\n\nNearly every single aspect of this class is fundamentally flawed.\n\nLectures: Extremely tangential, and do not help with furthering one's knowledge of web development or the completion of assignments whatsoever (beyond the bare minimum threshold). Most of what's given in lecture is very arbitrary trivia, with either no explanation of how underlying technologies work or such cursory overviews of the technology that no human without prior experience would be able to understand anything. Attendance is extremely low for a reason\n\nLabs: These are supposed to take 50 minutes in class, however, in reality, they take days to complete. \n\nAccessibility: It's really funny that we spend an entire lecture on accessibility for users of websites at the beginning of the school year, because exactly none of those considerations seemed to have been applied to this course. Many design students were initially in the course, and they were required to do some of the same beginning assignments as CS concentrators as a part of the design track of the course. CS concentrators were having trouble with these assignments. There are almost no design students left in the class, most of them having dropped out within the first month. What a mystery. \n\nAssignments: Incorrect information on assignment deadlines and requirements are sometimes given out in class, leading to massive confusion. Assignment sheets are generally very vague, poorly worded, and do not contain the necessary information needed to complete the assignment, making TA hours a necessity. This is already somewhat frustrating, but read onward to see why it becomes even more problematic. \n\nTA Hours: Given the lack of support from lecture, the large size of the course, and the nature of web development being very self-learning heavy, one would expect there to be plentiful TA hours in the course. The opposite is true. There is only one TA session per day, and even those sessions are understaffed. There are usually at least 10 to 20 tickets in line the moment hours start. Often times, even signing up the moment hours begin still places you outside of the students seen by the TAs, by a significant margin. And because of the structure of the course, even when you do get to see a TA, sometimes they are unable to help you. This happens in many ways: \n\nOne case is with design TAs: design TAs exist to help designers, and so often times, there is only one TA to help with coding. Having design TAs is not necessarily a problem, however, because of aforementioned reasons, there are essentially no designers left in the class. It is common to see hours where the coding TA is overwhelmed by students and the design TA is left with nothing to do.\n\nAnother case is with technologies. For example, for the chatroom assignment, many of the TAs were only familiar with vanilla javascript and unfamiliar with React, so these TAs were simply unable to help concentrators working on the React version of the assignment.\n\nHowever, I don't want to fault the TAs, because most of them have been extremely friendly and helpful on the occasions I was able to interact with them. I think more blame goes to the structure and organization of the course.\n\nIn conclusion:\nFuck this class.\n","date":"Mar 18, 2019, 10:00 AM"},{"content":"3461 - cw: divest, israel/palestine\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAs a Muslim student at Brown, I'm offended by the use of the Islamic greeting in the advertising material of \"Vote No on Brown Divest.\" I'd also like to pose a few questions to the organizers of this event: Have you included any Muslim or Palestinian students in your organizing efforts?

I just find it weird how we pay so much attention to trans women and drag queens but I don't see any notable \"\"drag kings\"\" or trans men being featured on television shows and news articles. Maybe it has to do with appearances. Trans women in media usually dress so loudly and gaudily, which catches people's attention unlike trans men, who, if anything, \"\"dress down\"\" to fit in. Idk.

Why do I feel like he tries to change everything about me. Why do I feel like I am being molded? I feel the personality I know and love coming under attack. Guys am I being controlled or is this all in my head? Am I just a plaything or is it when he’s disappointed when I can’t meet his expectations it’s becuause he cares so much? I won’t find anyone like him- he’s the best thing to ever happen to me and I’m grateful for his very presence.

If he leaves me I might die. \n\nA student just like you all here- I’m so inexperienced in love but how do I stop disappointing the person I care most about? My parents never loved me and I never loved myself. I have no friends here at Brown and he’s the only one who ever asks how I’m doing. I can’t lose him- I’d do anything to keep him. People say this grown man is no good for me, but can’t they say that he’s the only one besides CAPS who at least pretends to listen to my insecurities? My hopes and my dreams? But my personality has been my rock and if I have to choose I’d choose my individuality. \n\nWhy do I feel this way, Dear Blueno? Nothing he says to me is, taken literally, anything but loving and kind, so why do they make me feel so heartbroken? Why can’t I say the right things? How can I make him see how much I UTTERLY WORSHIP HIM? He is my whole world, the reason I eat, sleep, and shower. Yet I’ve disappointed him AGAIN. I’m not good enough for him! Just like I’m never good enough for my parents. \n\nDamm it. Sometimes I don’t dress up enough when I see him- he tells me how I must take him for granted. What was I thinking? Sometimes I argue about stuff that he’s more experienced about. Why do I do that? He hates arrogance and I must seem like the queen of it. He could see other girls but he doesn’t. Girls who are nicer than I am. I try to hold my tongue when he speaks but sometimes I can’t help it. Why???? He calls me an argumentative bitch and I deserve it. He always said he likes nice girls.

Though I am not one of the leaders of the house or on the board, I am a member, and I do think a lot of these criticisms brought up are valid. However, some of the information is misconstrued. \n\nFirstly, to the concern that some people believe AAA house intentionally tried to exclude non East Asian identities, I do not believe that was the case or their intention. The only newletter or public forum that I saw AAA house being promoted on was KASA's. I do not believe it was on CSA/BTS/VSA/JCA or other East Asian organizations, and I just believe it was due to the starters of the house being new to this entire system. I do believe they should have tried to make a better effort in informing the general public about the creation of the house in order to be more inclusive of the pan-ethnic identity. The house was approved around the beginning, but not immediately at the start of the second semester which is why there was not a lot of time to circulate the information about the house. Though this is just an excuse, I think it is important to be understanding and allow for the board to learn from these mistakes. (@3331 and @3324) \n\nSecond, to address the issue of 85 applicants and only 25 selected, this is very misconstrued. The 85 refers to how many people indicated interest in having a house or a space for Asian American housing, but those individuals did not eventually want to commit to living in the house itself. Also, even though only 85 students filled out the form saying they were interested, it is hard to track how many actually saw the form or received some kind of email about it. Additionally, the issue of advertisement was addressed above. More importantly, a lot of us are complete strangers who are just getting to know each other, not just some friend group who wanted to live in Buxton together. (@3270)\n\nFinally, though these criticisms are valid and need to be addressed in the future of this house as a place for the PAN-ethnic Asian American/Asian identity, I believe that it is also important to not judge all the members or people participating in this house. Many of us were not involved with the application process or advertising, and just wanted to be part of this inclusive community. A lot of these posts might make some people living in the house afraid that those accusations and judgments are also being placed upon them, despite the fact that they were not part of the advertising and branding of the house. Additionally, some people in the house tried to tell others and spread the application, but it was difficult seeing many of those interested tended to be frosh. \n\nI hope in the future that AAA House can be a place that supports and promotes Asian American/Asian activism and I believe that there is still a lot of potential for this house. These mistakes are difficult to overlook but I think that this will be addressed in following housing years. Also, I believe that people can join the AAA family, even if they don't live in the house, so I hope that non-East Asians/Asian Americans would join and be involved with this community!\n\nhttps://aaa.cmail20.com/t/t-i-otkklz-l-r/\n","date":"Mar 18, 2019, 9:16 AM"},{"content":"3410 - Any recommendations of good History classes for the fall?\n","date":"Mar 18, 2019, 9:16 AM"},{"content":"3409 - New poll in from Quinnipiac: Brown Hockey is FUCKING ON IT RN\n","date":"Mar 18, 2019, 9:16 AM"},{"content":"3408 - beyonce for spring weekend\n","date":"Mar 18, 2019, 9:16 AM"},{"content":"3407 - I woke up at like 3am to the sound of squishy sounds coming from my roommate’s bed. ☹️ It sounded like an octopus was getting fingered.\n","date":"Mar 18, 2019, 9:15 AM"},{"content":"3406 - i hate cs i hate cs so fucking much all i want is money\n","date":"Mar 18, 2019, 9:15 AM"},{"content":"3405 - Stillwell on the hockey team......... is he single???\n","date":"Mar 18, 2019, 9:15 AM"},{"content":"3404 - im not a huge fan of sports, but brown men's hockey can like,,,,, GET IT\ny'all did THAT\n","date":"Mar 18, 2019, 9:15 AM"},{"content":"3403 - Dear Blueno,\nWhat is your favorite food to eat?\nThanks,\nRoxanne\n","date":"Mar 18, 2019, 9:15 AM"},{"content":"3402 - @cs people can someone make a keyboard that automatically types the mocking spongebob meme text (the upper case, lowers case, etc.)\n","date":"Mar 18, 2019, 9:15 AM"},{"content":"3401 - @all the ppl freaking out when someone points out the hyprocrisy in the whole “white people suck” debate are crazy\n\nSaying “white people suck” is a gross generalization and is offensive to a huge group of people, some of whom do suck but most of whom are great people.

finding a way to get people to take/engage in more diverse activities/classes would be a good way to also get a more diversity in opinions and discussions as a learning experience for everyone involved.\n\nwhy this is consistent with brown/higher education's values:\n\n- since one of the purposes of higher education is to expand and challenge worldviews and get people to learn broadly, many colleges already have something like this (community service requirement or some kind of class requirement). doing this for brown would not be any different \n- the point of brown's open curriculum and educational mission is to promote diverse exploration and have us challenge our perceptions - this would be a way to make sure people don't leave brown having literally only participated in activities for/taken classes in one thing, something very possible to do on this campus despite it not being the purpose of a liberal arts education.\n- we already have a writ requirement in place which i think most people can agree doesn't really limit our choices on what classes to take in our education. another type of some sort of diversity-challenge-your-worldview requirement wouldn't necessarily need to limit what classes we chose either if it was done similarly to writ. and a lot of people might find that they enjoyed the whatever class or activity they participated in that was really different from anything they were exposed to previously, and that it added something really valuable to their education\n\nthoughts?\"\n","date":"Mar 15, 2019, 7:11 PM"},{"content":"3327 - Anyone know how I can get in touch with a Shake Shack worker?

However, there's no possible means for us to voice our concerns- the possibility that this Professor, Paul Valiant, who honestly gave some of the most dis-organized lectures I've attended at Brown- will continue to teach many other bright, students at Brown, is horrifying to me. There's also such a huge disconnect between the coursework lectured in class and homework given. He's not responsive as a professor - I have a friend who emailed him multiple times trying to talk about the course with him, but he never responded. The lecture notes were NEVER, EVER posted on time and I know this was not the fault of the HTAs, but PAUL VALIANT, THE PROFESSOR. \n\nGuys, we have a voice, and hold the power to determine the future of Brown's faculty and the future experience of undergraduates & graduates.

Just like you guys, we are also diverse and come from a variety of different socio-economic backgrounds. The assumption that the sector of very wealthy and absurdly privileged international students are representative of us all is not only hurtful but also alienates us from the local Brown community. Many of my international friends and peers are on hard earned scholarships and full financial aid (which is highly difficult to obtain as an international student since Brown is need-aware for non-Americans), and have made several sacrifices to come halfway across the world to benefit from an education their country couldn’t offer them. International students also face visa fears, being homesick and working to assimilate into a culture very different from their own. We willingly made this choice to come to America, yes, and are grateful for the educational opportunities we find here but that doesn’t mean we’re not allowed to feel lonely, frustrated and misunderstood at times. This post isn’t made with the intention of being hateful or confrontational, but simply with the hope of drawing attention to the fact that broad generalisations about international students don’t apply to the entire community.\n","date":"Mar 14, 2019, 11:28 AM"},{"content":"3189 - Why does fencing get parkas?

It sucks, and it isn’t exactly fair on a case-by-case basis. On a macro level, yes, women do face obstacles in CS, and it would make sense to correct for that disparity by favoring women when hiring. But that doesn’t mean that the individual woman who got a job necessarily faced more obstacles than the individual man who get rejected. I think that’s what can be frustrating about AA. Some dude who went to a shitty public high school and never had a computer as a kid could have his CS internship spot taken by some high-income heavily-tutored white women with slightly worse grades than him. I know this is kind of a logical fallacy (proof by example?) but you have to admit that the current affirmative action system can and does allow this hypothetical situation to happen. It’s just kind of fucked to know that your spot was taken by someone less qualified than you, just because people of their demographic—not necessarily the individual themself—face barriers that people of your demographic—not necessarily you— do not face.

Though he understood that the role of an official was his to play for many years, that time had come to an end. \nHe carried with him none of the material wealth that had become his during his years as an official. He strode forth from the gate at Chengzhou until he was stopped by the guard Yinxi. Though not an educated man, Yinxi was at birth blessed with an innate wisdom. Sensing the unordinariness of the man before him, Yinxi at once implored the master to take him as a disciple. Seeing that Yinxi was worthy of teaching, Laozi accepted his three kowtows.\nTeacher and student lived as recluses for many years, taking up the plough in the western part of Luoyang. One day, Kong Zi (Confucius) traveled there to survey and educate the rulers of Qi and Lu. Having met with Duke Jing and Ji Huanzi of Qi, Confucius did not long stay at their courts and then departed. \nLaozi and Yinxi were ploughing the fields in harness together. Confucius passed by and sent his disciple Zilu over to ask directions. Laozi sensed the extraordinary nature of the man in the carriage and asked Zilu, “Who is that holding the carriage reins?” \nZilu said, “That is Kong Qiu.”\n“Kong Qiu of Lu?”\n“Yes.”\n“Why, then, he knows where he can go!”\nUpon hearing this response, Confucius immediately stepped down, wishing to speak with him. \nAt once observing that the man in the field was a master, Confucius bowed and inquired as to his identity.\nLaozi responded: “I am no one of note. I am only a scholar who pursues the Dao.”\nLaozi then invited Confucius into his hut in order to drink tea.\nConfucius spoke initially. Curious to learn from one so famously enamored with the Dao, he asked: “Should one not take pleasure in studying and practicing what one has learned? Someone with such talents as yourself could direct the path of nations.”\nLaozi truly possessed the qualifications of one untrammeled by matters not of the Dao. Setting down his tea, he thought for a moment before responding. “Never take over the world to tamper with it. Those who want to tamper with it are not fit to take over the world.”\n“Rather, Man is ruled by Earth. Earth is ruled by Heaven. Heaven is ruled by the Way. The Way is ruled by itself. I cannot deny that which is demanded by the Way.” Saying so, he reached towards Confucius. He deftly undid the belt around Confucius’s robe. \nThe scholarly robe slipped to the ground in a pile of navy silk. \n+++\nIt would not do to describe what then transpired as a perfect union of man and man. Instead, it was a messy, violent, passionate affair—much like the later intercourse between their respective ideological doctrines. \nGroping the swollen member underneath his partner’s silken hanfu pants, Laozi nodded with rare approval. “Perhaps the truth of the ‘lumpy’ nickname given to you in your youth was actually in reference to your ‘Son of Heaven’, eh?”\nNot to be outdone in the proper ceremonies, Confucius returned the gesture. “And this is the Daoist virility that I’ve read so much about?”\nLaozi dropped to his knees, resembling an official kowtowing to his superiors. However, his tongue was far more talented than any sycophantic minister’s could hope to be, quickly bringing his partner to a shuddering-breath, toe-clenching climax. Breathing strained, Confucius clawed at Laozi’s shoulders and pulled him into a tight embrace. Their bodies intertwined, panting, on the floor as the embrace continued into a impassioned kiss. Strands of spittle and ejaculate mixed together, a physical manifestation of the indelible mark left upon each other’s hearts. \n+++\nYinxi and Zilu stood to the side, respectfully watching the two masters. \n“Master,” Yinxi asked, “is this too the Dao?” \n“Master,” Zilu asked, “is this the virtue of Man of which you speak? Of what lǐ is this man worthy?”\nLaozi responded thusly: “Can one unite the body and the spirit as one and embrace the ‘Oneness’ without departing from the great Dao?” After meditating upon the response, Yinxi then saw through the nature of his teacher’s actions and understood that they were in accord with the Dao. \nConfucius responded thusly: “I cannot flock together with the birds and beasts! If I am not a fellow traveler with a man such as this, then with whom? If only the Dao prevailed in the world I would not have to try to change it!”\nThe two masters understood that their meeting was ephemeral. Alas, they each thought, that such a worthy I shall not meet again. \nIn time, their meeting would come to be recorded in the Analects *(See 18.6).\n+++\nSitting back upon the wagon, Confucius caressed the robe given to him by Laozi after their bodily fluids had rendered his previous Hanfu unusable. He ran his fingers along the coarse linen, remembering his short but unforgettable encounter. However, used to the silk finery of the imperial court, he thought to himself, “Wow this really chafes my nips.”\n\n(plz rate & review, very enthused to see other works pop up on DB ♥)\n","date":"Mar 11, 2019, 3:14 PM"},{"content":"3061 - Do bars in providence card just to get in?

They died tragically while he was still a baby from a Russian nerve agent planted by the mysterious Voldemort. No one knew who he was nor where he came from except that he was a Russian operative with a French alias. Harry’s maternal aunt and uncle - Petunia and Vernon Dursley - raised him and told him that his parents were alcoholics who died in a car crash. It wasn’t until Harry got accepted at Brown and went to ADOCH that he learnt the truth. His cousin Dudley went to Cornell.\n\nThat was why Harry struggled through Russian language courses and took Snape’s Eurasian politics courses; he needed to be prepared for when the time came to track down and destroy his parents’ murderer. Dumbledore believed in him even though Voldemort was an international menace and Harry was a 22 year-old who had never left the northeast. Harry’s career plan was to join the CIA after he graduated so he could find Voldemort and kill him, probably with a bunch of cool special agent gadgets like a glasses-wearing James Bond. Hermione thought this was a stupid plan and wanted him to cultivate his passion for teaching, but Ron thought it was super cool.\n\nLater that evening over mozzarella sticks and spicy withs at Jos, Harry tried to get Hermione to join in the speculation over who submitted his BBA. \n\n“Honestly, Harry.

If he’s interested, he will and if not, then you can start focusing on Snape’s midterm again.”\n\n“Don’t you think it’s weird that after years of wanting to teach a course on the anti-hero in Dostoevsky's novels that Brown finally approved the him to last fall? Remember how furious he was Lupin when taught Crime and Punishment?”\n\n“Harry, you always think that either Malfoy or Snape are plotting the downfall of the US or at least Brown. They never are. You should focus on passing the courses you’re actually taking.”\n\n“Stop being such an overachiever, Hermione. Look at me, I’ve only ever taken classes S/NC and see how much happier I am than you.” Ron tended to be a bit tactless. \n\nHarry decided to follow Hermione’s advice - she had dated a famous footballer after all - and posted another comment on his BBA. “DM me if you want to hang out or something ;).” Malfoy had added an angry react to Harry’s first comment. \n\nHermione and Ron were arguing about who should replace Neville as their sixth Gryffindor team mate for trivia. Hermione thought that they’d be fine as a five member team - “since I answer most of the questions anyway” - but Ron wanted to invite someone cool. \n\nHarry didn’t want to listen to them bicker anymore. “I’ll invite someone cool. Someone really cool. OK?” Surprisingly, Hermione and Ron agreed to this, and they settled into the more comfortable topic of complaining about how the Ivy Room had eliminated both its falafels and tacos. Harry checked Facebook again. No one had replied to his BBA comment, except for Malfoy. He’d written “Potter stinks 🤢.” As far as insults went, Malfoy was performing below par. There were, however, a number of new highly opinionated Dear Blueno posts about Canada Goose, circumcision, wealth-shaming, and the Lucius Malfoy dinners.\n\nRita Skeeter at the ProJo had broken the news that Brown alumnus and Wealthy Donor, Lucius Malfoy, was colluding with the Brown administration to offer secret dinners for the wealthiest Brown students to schmooze with potential future employers. The leak turned out to be Draco himself, who never stopped talking about “what my father will do when he hears about this.” Dean Thomas out of curiosity actually listened to what Draco was saying once. It turned out that Draco had been telling everyone for years about the dinners, but no one had ever paid attention before. Dean got all the details about how the Malfoy dinners operated and who got invited, and submitted the exposé to the ProJo since there were rumors Lucius Malfoy partially funded the BDH. Harry had gotten an e-vite every year. All four remained unopened along with over 3,000 other emails of varying importance. Ron was still extremely salty that he had never been invited: “My whole family’s gone to Brown for generations. Why am I never included in anything?” \n\nHarry suddenly thought that Hermione might be right. Maybe Harry did think about Malfoy a bit too much....\n\nTo Be Continued….\nA.N.

These women who you cite as gaining internships are far more qualified than you realize and maybe the reason why you think you are more qualified than them has to do with your inflated ego or lack of respect for these women. \nAs a women in CS, I can assure you that sexism exists. I was raised with dolls and taught to be a mother while you were given legos and told to be an engineer. I'm sure that your family supported your desires to study CS, even pushed you towards it. I've gone to tech events and been straight up told I was lost or gotten confused stares. As a man in CS, you automatically have this group of friends; you have your CS bros who you play video games with and attend hackathons with. Women are never part of these teams because guys don't see us as equal and don't include us in their friend groups. Consequently, we are hardly ever part of the all male startup team or the all male hackathon team. Usually, we find the few other women in the room and attend to team up. I went to a coding competition once with me and two other women. When the timer started, a supervisor approached us and encouraged us to wait for the men to arrive, because god forbid we start on our own. When guys allow me on their teams, it is usually because they are interested in my body, not my brains. I've seen men have access to way more opportunities through connections. In larger teams, the men hang out, work together, and uplift each other, while the women are left out of the loop. I could go on. \nI'm sure every woman in the CS department could share dozens of stories of the sexism that they have experienced, but I'm also sure that you never bother to ask them about it.\n","date":"Mar 10, 2019, 4:05 PM"},{"content":"3017 - A powerful message, reposted because people need to read this: \n\nHello. I was born and raised in the Bay Area- a hub for CS in particular. And yet, I'm here to tell you that being a woman in tech is not all sunshine and internships. \nI was never raised to believe that CS could be a path for myself. My parents always told me I should be a doctor instead, and at pretty much every turn I made in CS at the beginning, there were stumbling blocks that- I would argue- a male in a similar situation would not face. Have you ever gone to interesting lectures and been specifically been singled out for being the only male? Have you ever been bullied for performing at a level equal to your female peers (I wasn't even better- just equal!) Have you ever had someone suggest that you should be doing the design work in your group project (considered to be the \"easier\" stuff), even though you never volunteered that you had experience with it because men are supposed to have the better eye for it? This is all shit that happened to me in the Bay. I wouldn't have believed it either, but unfortunately it's not always the meritocratic utopia it seems. \nIt's not like the representation of women in big tech companies is all that much? You're feeling all oppressed and shit when women aren't anywhere close to half of all tech jobs at big tech companies despite making up half the population, and 60% of college degrees? These statistics are for employment at big companies in the past few years. https://www.statista.com/.../female-employees-at-tech.../\nAll that being said, I definitely think Brown makes an effort to create a welcoming environment for anyone who wants to try CS and make it here. I have had much less of an issue here. \nAll this just to provide a bit of a human perspective before we go over a couple of educational links :)\nhttps://www.recode.net/.../women-discrimination-pew...\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_disparity_in_computing\nThe idea that computer science and math and STEM is for men begins early on in life. http://ilabs.washington.edu/.../11Cevencek_Meltzoff...\nhttps://www.oregonlive.com/.../teacher_bias_helps_steer...\nHere's a whole fucking book on a few reasons for the disparity. https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED509653\nIt sounds like you have a bit of a chip on your shoulder from struggling with internship applications. We get it. It's hard out there. You're being ghosted. You're receiving a million \"Thank you for your time, we've decided to move forward with other candidates\". You're wondering why, after all these all-nighters and missed parties, you still can't get one fucking callback. The job market is tough out there. \nConsider that the problem is not the women around you. Don't go around looking for someone to blame just because you can't pass your technical interviews :) \nAs president of the CS DUG, we host technical interview prep sessions multiple times in the fall, for women, men, and anyone else who wants to be prepared to get those sweet, sweet offers. Feel free to DM me if you would like to be added to the listserv!

Harry, Neville, Ron, and Hermione all shared a suite, which was really awkward when Ron wasn’t speaking to Harry or when he and Hermione were fighting. Neville was a Bio major who loved plants. He was a really nice, quiet guy who had suddenly become super fit over the summer between junior and senior year. He had a large collection of venomous plants scattered throughout the suite.\n\n“Hey Neville, look at this BBA I got! Who do you think could possibly have submitted it?”\n\n“Wow, Harry! That’s kind of violent. Is this a reference to when you and Ron stole that car?”\n\nHarry rolled his eyes. “We didn’t steal it. We ‘borrowed’ it.”\n\n“If you say so. Are you sure this means someone likes you?”\n\n“Neville, you’re such a normie.”\n\n“I don’t know what that means, but I’ll take it as a compliment. Maybe Justin Finch-Fletchley? He talked about you all the time during second year.”\n\n“That’s because he thought I might be a member of the Russian crime ring that killed my parents.”\n\n“Oh, right. But he’s not dating anyone right now. He’s part of my lab, and he’s always complaining about how there aren’t any good guys who want to date guys at Brown.”\n\nHarry thought that Justin was probably hitting on the newly hot Neville, but Neville could figure this out on his own. “We’re still on for GCB trivia tomorrow, right?”\n\nNeville turned pale. “That’s tomorrow night? Damn, I really have to finish this thesis draft. I don’t think I’ll be able to make it.”\n\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Ron’s older twin brothers, Fred and George, were all on the same GCB trivia team, the Gryffindors. The team name had been passed down through the Weasley family, but it’s meaning was a mystery to even them. Fred and George worked in Boston running a startup, and had graduated from Brown during Harry’s second year. They were famous for their independent concentrations in Pre-MEME Humor and Post-MEME Humor respectively. They had both doubled in MEME (the electronic music concentration). \n\nHarry jumped off the couch, rushed past a flustered Neville, and ran to Ron’s door. “RON!” he yelled, banging his fist on the door, “NEVILLE’S GOING TO MISS TRIVIA AGAIN TOMORROW! WE NEED ANOTHER REPLACEMENT! LAVENDER IS NOT AN OPTION! HERMIONE WOULD KILL US OR LEAVE THE TEAM! I GOT A BBA FROM A MYSTERIOUS STRANGER!”\n\nRon opened his door. “There’s no need to shout, Harry. These doors are really thin. Also, I’m dating Hermione again, and I know she hates Lavender. Why do you think I’d invite her?” \n\nLast time Neville had bailed on them, Ron had invited his current girlfriend Lavender without telling anyone whom his was bringing. Hermione refused to answer any questions, and so they had received zero points on every round other than the music round. Lavender was surprising good at that. Lavender studied MCM and loved to talk about ‘theory;’ Hermione had disliked her even before she dated Ron. \n\n“You got a BBA? Wow! Do you think it’s from Romilda Vane? I wish Hermione would submit a BBA about me.” (Lavender had submitted many BBA’s about Ron; Hermione had not.)\n\n“No, I think it’s from a guy. Here, read it.”\n\n“But you don’t like guys, right? I mean, you’ve only ever dated girls.”\n\n“Maybe I do. I just haven’t thought about it. And by girls, you mean Cho, Cedric’s ex, right? That’s one girl and we broke up after our only date at the Duck and Bunny. Hermione had scheduled an interview at the same time with the Brown Noser so that I could tell the world that I saw Voldemort at the Brown Corporation meeting I snuck into. And Cho completely misunderstood why Hermione had access to my Google Calendar.”\n\n“I guess that’s true. Who could’ve written this? Are people still angry about when we ‘borrowed’ the car?”\n\n“WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK THIS IS ABOUT THE STUPID CAR! THAT WAS YEARS AGO!” Harry had a tendency to talk in all-caps when upset or embarrassed. \n\n“Mom’s still angry with me about it. She kept mentioning last summer how I should actually take the driving test so next time I steal a car at least I’ll be legally able to drive.” (Harry also still did not have a driver’s license.) “We should ask Hermione. She’s basically wikipedia.” \n\nHarry somehow doubted that Hermione’s knowledge extended to his secret admirers, but she had dated a former Bulgarian soccer (football) star and visiting grad student at the John Carter Brown Library last year. She broke up with him after he went back to Europe; she didn’t want a high-profile and long-distance relationship. Viktor had been a very helpful addition to the trivia time last year as he knew more about sports than Harry or Ron, who both only knew Hockey trivia.\n\n“Where is Hermione, anyway?”\n\n“Oh, she’s just at one of her YDSA meetings. Poor thing, she still thinks she can convince other Brown students to become socialists.” Hermione was president of the Brown Democratic Socialists Club, which was far more popular than Harry or Ron had thought possible. Still, there were far fewer socialists at Brown than Dear Blueno would lead you to believe. \n\nTo Be Continued…\n\nA.N.

For context, my personal stance is that Israel should remain in existence, but should end oppressive and discriminatory policies and should grant equal rights and freedoms to Palestinians.\n\nHowever, I’m wondering how anti-Zionists (people who don’t believe Israel should exist at all as a Jewish state) would feel about this hypothetical non-Jewish replacement for Israel if it were to not respect women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, freedom of the press, etc. How can you guarantee that this new state would embrace democratic ideals, when virtually every other country in the region does not? Is your anti-Zionism so strong that you would risk the basic rights and freedom of millions, just so that the state religion would no longer be Judaism?\n\nThat’s what I don’t get about full-force anti-Zionism. Like, fuck Netanyahu, fuck other right-wing politicians, fuck military officers who allow brutality. Fuck the laws that discriminate againsts Arabs and Palestinians. I’m with you on all of that.

They were all just \"legitimately protect[ing] their fellow citizens from harm.\"\n\nThe IDF has a culture which denies Palestinians' humanity and perpetuates such abuses against them.

If your cryptologist bros aren't willing to address this, then they're complicit.\n","date":"Mar 9, 2019, 3:53 PM"},{"content":"2917 - @2840 + other \"stop being poor posts\"\n\nI don't think you should feel scared or ashamed, but acknowledge your privileges and know that a significant percentage of people at Brown haven't had them and have had to work extremely hard to get even a margin of them. You mentioned that you \"felt like one of the poorest people there\"- please consider how this can be a daily experience for many students at Brown during simple conversations, like for example, obsessing over formals, if buying dresses comes up. \n\nI think reflecting on how something like the Granoff dinner, or similar events and opportunities you've had, can become more open to students of all backgrounds and incomes is more productive than seeing the discussions around Granoff as shame on you. Having an insider perspective can help dismantle the classism and elitism that is rooted in these events, and you could really help with that. Ex: If you managed to meet some alumni that attended these dinners, why not invite them to speak at Brown as part of a public networking event, a panel, a CareerLab workshop, etc. so that they can contribute to the wellbeing and opportunities of Brown's overall student body?\n\nI'm going to guess that your defensiveness and the defensiveness of similar posts comes from ignorance or chosen ignorance. It sounds like many of the pushback posts to the anger surrounding Granoff, are coming from people who have never experienced or talked to someone about how not having enough money really feels. How not being able to buy groceries, or clothes, or go to the doctor, or pay rent feels, and how heavy and anxiety inducing thinking about what you can and cannot afford is. And assuming that people can just, get out of not being able to afford these things by just working hard and having their chin up is again more of the same ignorance or chosen ignorance. To me it signals that you may not have really heard out the stories of families struggling with these issues. \n\nIf that's you, try to find a way to read, hear, see, or talk about these experiences. If not through late night heavy talks with friends, working/volunteering in the greater Providence community (ie. literally anywhere in Providence except for Federal Hill and College Hill, get off your high hill and get learning) is a great way to do that because it will connect you to students who really care about closing the many inequalities that exist in America, and expose you to the realities of income inequality in Providence. Ask people why they volunteer and you will learn a lot about how these issues have affected them personally. Listen to the stories of the people and families you are serving to put yourself in their shoes and see what needs to change in our communities to help all people, not just those with the financial means to help themselves and their peers. \n\nHope this is more empowering than lecture-y. I don't want to believe that everyone who went to this fancy-ass dinner is the monopoly man incarnate and wants to live off of the poor, but I do want to believe that you'll get yourself informed and care about people, no matter how much money is in their pocket.\n","date":"Mar 9, 2019, 3:53 PM"},{"content":"2916 - Any advice for first time meth users??

He knew better than to expect a BBA post since he wasn’t involved in theater, or band, or anything besides hockey (and for some reason, hockey players never seemed to get BBA’s). But Gala would be in a couple days and he didn’t have a date. Normally he wouldn’t have cared - most people at Gala don’t have dates - but all his friends had dates and he didn’t want to be the only senior without one. \n\nHermione has told him that he was being silly, and that he should be focusing on the important midterm for Eurasian politics they had on Friday. However, Harry knew that studying would make absolutely no difference; Snape hated him, which is why Harry only ever took his courses S/NC. There were rumors that Snape had secret ties to the Russian government. He openly favored students who shared his political leanings, like Draco Malfoy. Malfoy had been Harry’s archenemy since ADOCH, and they exclusively referred to each other by their last names,, much to the bemusement of their peers. Malfoy was super rich and wore his Canada Goose jackets with pride. \n\nHarry was startled out of his musings on Malfoy’s numerous terrible qualities with a Facebook notification; Ginny had tagged him on a new BBA post. Ginny was Harry’s best friend Ron’s younger (and cooler) sister. She was on the women’s rugby team, and was constantly getting BBA’s from other queer women.\n\nLooking at the post, Harry couldn’t believe his eyes; he had gotten a BBA! It read: \"I wish Harry Potter would run me over 🔥 Does he date guys? (please don’t out anyone).\" Did Harry date guys? He’d never really thought about it. He had been a bit obsessed with Cedric - the captain of the Polar Bears who’d graduated two years ago - but then everyone thought Cedric was hot (and kind, and smart, and...wait, did that mean Harry had a crush on Cedric?). Well, no one could say that Harry wasn’t brave. He decided to type a response. He wrote: \"Thanks! ;).\" Harry knew he could not flirt to save his life, but Ron was even worse.\n\nHarry saw that Malfoy had also posted a comment. \"Haha, who would fancy Saint Potter? I bet he can’t even drive.\" Everyone at Brown in Harry’s class year (‘19) knew he could drive. During his 2nd year, he and Ron had ‘borrowed’ Ron’s family’s car to drive back to school after winter break during a blizzard because their flights had been canceled. They had ended up making it all the way from Pennsylvania to Brown without too many problems until they ran into the fence surrounding the Quiet Green. They had become quite the popular meme on BDSM. Luckily, Dumbledore had replaced CPax as President of Brown by then, and only chuckled when he found out. Hermione kept telling them that they were lucky they hadn’t been suspended, but Dumbledore never suspended anyone. \n\nHarry wanted to ask Ron who could have submitted the BBA, but Ron wasn’t speaking t him right now. Harry had made a last minute concentration switch from Public Policy to Education. Ron was only concentrating in Public Policy because Harry was, so they could take the exact same classes and study together. He felt that Harry’s switch was a massive betrayal because Harry was only taking Education concentration requirements this semester. Harry had been undeclared for so long, he didn’t have time to finish the final requirements for two concentrations. Hermione has encouraged him to make the switch and follow his passion for teaching, and assured Harry that Ron would come around soon. She was a triple-concentrator in IR, English, and History, and the best academic advisor at Brown despite still being an undergrad. \n\nTo Be Continued…\n(Please Rate and Review!)\n","date":"Mar 9, 2019, 3:53 PM"},{"content":"2909 - I just want boba\n","date":"Mar 9, 2019, 3:53 PM"},{"content":"2908 - I absolutely despise my roommate, why does ResLife do such a shitty job at matching roommates?\n","date":"Mar 9, 2019, 3:53 PM"},{"content":"2907 - Tag your favorite single Muslim boys/Men (so I am aware of their existence, because frankly speaking, your girl is dying alone).\n","date":"Mar 9, 2019, 3:53 PM"},{"content":"2906 - cw: idf, israel discourse\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nThere is no excuse for being a member of an imperialist military that oppresses your neighbors.

On the one hand, it is a military that should be held accountable when it uses force on protesters, doesn’t exercise due regard for civilians’ lives, and enforces unjust policies. But the IDF also holds a very important position in Israeli society, much different than the US military in our society. Almost every Israeli citizen is drafted into the IDF, making military service a common experience that unifies Israelis. While some soldiers volunteer for combat roles, most soldiers hold non-combat positions (healthcare, logistics, civil engineering, cyberwarfare, training, etc). Unlike in the US, where our military kind of just waits around and prepares for potential conflicts, the IDF is active everyday. Israel is a tiny country that neighbors countries that don’t like it. Rocket attacks, stabbings, and shootings are not uncommon. Preventing and responding to these attacks is part of the IDF’s job. The IDF also launches fairly frequent humanitarian missions to other countries (most recently Brazil, Syria, Mexico, and some others). When you berate someone for being a former IDF member, it is unlikely that you’re talking to someone who had any involvement in the oppression of Palestinians. More likely, you’re talking to a cryptologist who helped thwart a Hezbollah stabbing attack, a medic who aided war refugees in Syria, or a technician who shot down rockets that were raining down on Tel Aviv. The decision to encroach upon and occupy Palestinian land is not up to members of the IDF. These decisions stem from right-wing politicians who don’t represent the average Israeli. Don’t take your rightful anger regarding Israeli policy out on IDF soldiers who legitimately protected their fellow citizens from harm.\n","date":"Mar 7, 2019, 2:01 PM"},{"content":"2862 - y cs when u can ds?\n","date":"Mar 7, 2019, 2:01 PM"},{"content":"2861 - @girl who posted about thighs.

I see virtue signaling all the time on campus, and especially here on this page. It's a big buzzword, but I feel like a lot of people don't really understand how it operates or why it's harmful. \n\nIf you're in a position of privilege about a topic being shared (even if you hold an unrelated marginalized identity), and you decide to comment on a post, or speak up in person, it's important to think about why you're commenting and what you're getting out of it. \n\nFor example, if there's a toxic post talking about race, I often see \"woke\" people who I know aren't a part of the targeted identity tagging their friends with things like \"yikes\" and \"wow what an idiot\" without actually engaging with the content. I can't help but think that the people who do this are only doing so to signal their virtue on a public forum. They're not contributing to the conversation. They're not using their privilege to educate someone about why their words are harmful. They're making a lazy post to signal some fake superiority over the toxic content, and arguably making things worse for actual marginalized people in the process. \n\nThis is of course not at all directed at those who are personally affected by posts and who (rightfully) express their anger about the content. \n\nThis is directed at all the \"allies\" who are in a position of privilege where they can step in and help improve a situation, but instead make lazy virtue-signaling comments and wait for the actual affected parties to do the labor of educating. If you recognize that this is something you do, I want you to ask yourself next time you feel compelled to comment: why am I doing this? Am I here to help, or am I here to make myself look good? \n\nThen next time, instead of writing a lazy call-out comment, please use your privilege to educate or just don't say anything at all.\n","date":"Mar 7, 2019, 2:01 PM"},{"content":"2849 - Is Donald Trump really that bad though???Look at all the jobs he’s bringing back to America...\n","date":"Mar 7, 2019, 2:01 PM"},{"content":"2845 - I was not thrilled when I first started getting nocturnal emissions.\n","date":"Mar 7, 2019, 2:01 PM"},{"content":"2847 - Why do pads without wings even exist\n","date":"Mar 7, 2019, 2:01 PM"},{"content":"2848 - IM Softball better watch out for the Hallway Dwellers 👀👀\n","date":"Mar 7, 2019, 2:01 PM"},{"content":"2846 - Why do people let the door slam behind them loudly and disruptively when they walk in halfway through lecture?

My point is that this student essentially treated this political presentation by a student group as if it were a calculus lecture. Regardless of your political views, you have to admit that’s a scary thing. When you’re presented with a new idea, you have 3 main options. 1) Disagree/reject; 2) Appreciate the idea and let it inform your views on a subject; 3) accept the idea as objective truth, and close your mind to other possibilities. In a STEM class, with a reputable professor who has no reason to mislead you, you can follow option 3. But an idea political in nature should always be met with options 1 or 2.

Here's a bit about my experience there. I'm a little hesitant to write about this, but I did get a weird, slightly guilty feeling from attending and what I saw, so I thought I'd write a bit about it.\n\nI obviously want to keep anonymous because of the current atmosphere around here, but for a bit of background: I was certainly invited because of my parents' stature and relationship with MG. My parents are pretty wealthy, but no one you would've heard of unless you happen to be closely connected to the industry my mom is huge in. My dad is also a kind of bigwig in a specific medical field, so they've known MG for a while now and it's just kind of a professional courtesy for him to invite people like me.\n\nAnyway, they got a lot of stuff right in the ProJo article, so I'll skip that mundane stuff and try and add what I can with my perspective. I actually went last year, not this year (for embarrassing, Bajas related reasons), but I assume it was pretty similar.\n\nAs my Lyft approached Al Forno, I tried to remember what my parents had told me in preparation for the dinner: mention them by name (so MG knew who I was), talk to him about my interest in business, and something about the word \"fidelio\". I checked the pockets of my Canada Goose to make sure I hadn't left my iPhone XS Max and Juul in the car, and walked in. When I got to receptionist at Al Forno, I mentioned that I was there for the MG dinner. She told me that it was actually a private event, but asked me if there was anything else I wanted to mention? I was kind of confused, but remembered what my dad had said and mumbled \"uhh, f..fidelio?\" She gave me a knowing smile and welcomed me. Huh, I thought my dad had just been joking.\n\nShe started walking into the kitchen, so I just stood waiting, but after a couple seconds she realized I wasn't following her and told me to follow. Weird! I followed her, past the delicious wafts, to the back right corner of the kitchen. We got to a huge, knurled door that looked very out of place in the back of Al Forno's otherwise modern-clean kitchen, but it didn't look bad, either. Strangely, there was no handle on the door, but there was a small hole in the wall, about an inch wide, at about ankle height, from the door. She told me to hang on a sec, and knelt down. I couldn't see super well because the area by the door wasn't lit very well, but she definitely reached into her mouth, winced a little, and then put something into the hole. The door immediately creaked open and I stepped into the foyer. The receptionist wiped the corner of her mouth and told me to enjoy. The door closed behind her, and I noticed that this side didn't seem to have a handle, either.\n\nEven the foyer was nice, though a tad strange. There was a doorman, but his eyes were closed and he didn't speak. He did, however, gesture for my coat, whimpering a little, and I handed it to him. He reached into his pockets (which seemed to make...wet sounds?) and produced a token in exchange for my coat. It was a little lock of red hair, about 3\" long, with a LV band around it. It seemed like there were little clumps of skin at one end of the lock of hair, but that's probably just some fashion thing I don't understand.\n\nI entered the main room, and damn, it was pretty! I went to the wine bar, where there was another man similar to the doorman. I got a wine of a name, color, smell, and taste I had never seen before. Everyone was already mingling. I saw a few people I recognized from class there, talking to wealthy looking older folks. It's kind of funny, when you imagine a special event with the \"ultra rich\", you might imagine $4,000 tailored suits, but most of these people were...pretty casual. A lot of dadcore, bad docksiders with baggy polo shirts, if you catch my drift. Then again, I guess you can dress like that when you buy and sell lesser lives as a side business.\n\nExcept for MG. Though I had never actually met him, despite going to his nephew's Bar Mitzvah ages ago, I guess I expected a typical 81 year old man. He was anything but. The first reason you'll notice him is that he's gotta be 6'8\", maybe more since he was hunched over to talk to the craven plebes near him. He's also just... bronze. And not in a trashy Trump way, but like he just got off the yacht from Mallorca. He's also weirdly yoked. He was wearing a beautifully tailored suit, in light tan, but it actually looked almost white against his glowing golden skin. And it wasn't of any material I had ever seen; it had an amazing texture, like leather, but finer, smoother.\n\nI had only been admiring him from a distance, passing the time until I got a chance with him by talking to another alumnus about his visionary business leveraging blockchain tech for disruptive AI to harness CRISPR or something. MG was periodically scanning the room he could see, but I was at about a 160 degree angle behind him, so he never saw me. As the alum was saying something about big data derivatives and his ethical role in tanking the Haitian economy, I suddenly started hearing... I'm not sure, Icelandic? chanting in my head. It seemed like no one else in the room could hear it. It was quickly getting louder and louder, drowning out the visionary, and I began to sway on my feet. Suddenly, I saw MG's head whip around to look me directly in the eyes, and it stopped as if I had never heard anything.\n\nHe excused himself from the current gaggle with a well-timed outro quip and lurched over to us. I say lurched, because I've never seen anything move like that before. It wasn't awkward; if anything, it was stealthy and elegant. It might be partly because of his size, but I didn't even hear any of his footsteps. He introduced himself with a rogueish smile and said \"...and you must be ___ ________\", using my nickname that only my closest friends call me. Closer, he smelled faintly of sandalwood, and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. While intently asking me about my interests, at one point he sneezed. It could have been the mystery vino and soft lighting, but I swear that as he was opening his eyes post-sneeze, they seemed to open sideways.\n\nI honestly don't know how long we talked, or what we talked about, but it felt like hours. He was wonderful at conversation, polite yet engaged, making it seem like what I was saying at that moment was the only thing in the world he cared about. He asked how my family was doing, and asked me in which order I would consume them. When I caught a glimpse of my watch, it said 7:50, but that didn't really make sense: the watch's hour hand was barely past the 7, and I had gotten out of the Lyft at 7:35 PM. But I wasn't going to complain; talking to him was the happiest I had been in as long as I could remember.\n\nFinally it was my turn to lose him, and he excused himself. He lurched to the center of the room and the lights dimmed slightly. We all instantly stopped (how could you not?) and turned our gazes to him, though it felt out of my control anyway. He barely moved his lips, but his voice filled the room, almost painfully loud. The red velvet on the walls suddenly seemed a little redder. He uttered that he had summoned someone very special there tonight, and from a spiral staircase in the center of the room that no one had noticed until that moment, up came Christina Paxson. She was wearing a Supreme hoodie that they had only released a non-integer number of, as well as Stan Smiths, but they weren't the classic white. They were a color and texture similar to MG's suit.\n\nHe said that it was time to consume of the knowledge of The Book. From her Fjallraven Kanken, CPax withdrew a tome of a texture not unlike her shoes, telling us it was a very special one from the John Hay library and that its contents would allow us to maximize the material in our capitalist paradise. As she said that, her eyes glimmered, and something in MG's pants rustled.\n\nOh, and what secrets they were. Though they were speaking backwards, alternating words, we understood all and I cannot go back to the time before. They told us to walk the garden of forking paths, but beware the fox eating itself. They told us that recycling is nonsense and that though gender is arbitrary, so is human life, so don't feel guilty if you must carve a mural of pain into flesh to succeed in the world of business. They told us how to fold a fitted sheet and to invest in vape-pacifiers, because they heard a hot tip that they would be legalized by 2023. Periodically, MG climbed into an Apparatus that inscribed these words into his back.\n\nThey began to tell us of MG's philanthropic miracles. His gills flared wealthily, and four of the eyeless eunuchs brought out his first generous donation to Brown: a life sized metal bull, almost as bronze as the deity himself. They also dragged out a cowering, nude, filthy child, his pupils the size of dinner plates, on a Gucci 2018 A/W leash. The eunuchs opened a door on the bull's rear, and MG produced from his beautiful suit an LED fidget spinner. Instantly the child snapped to attention, transfixed on the spinner. MG tossed it into the bull, and the child, released, scrambled after it on all fours into the bull. To be fair, it was a pretty sweet fidget spinner. They slammed the door shut and lit a fire beneath it, and then everyone clapped.\n\nAs the first hors d'oeuvres were being brought out by his wretched minions, CPax unzipped her humanskin. \"Holy shit\", I thought. \"They have pigs in a blanket?\"\n","date":"Mar 4, 2019, 3:46 PM"},{"content":"2713 - What is protocol for DMing a senior who you don't know and asking them if they want to scramble?\n","date":"Mar 4, 2019, 3:45 PM"},{"content":"2718 - Arabs at this school are more discriminated against than any other community.

Anyone who wants the context of this statistic can look it up and inform themselves to a superficial level within 10 minutes of googling. Just notice how OP doesn't make any comparisons to anyone with a \"better\" statistic. Ask oneself, if this information has always been available, why haven't planted questioners in Q&A sessions ever brought it up, or why did Clinton never bring this up during debates if it seems like such an obvious argument against his candidacy. Notice how OP writes their statement as if that one statistic makes their declaration fact. When someone's arguments are so weak as this, the foundations for their own beliefs are weak and fallible. When someone thinks a random statistic like this has merit, without doing any research about its context, they are desperate. When someone uses such a useless statistic to try and mislead others into sharing their weak beliefs, they are pathetic. Politicians, global warming, racism, antisemitism, whatever - this strategy has been employed in countless contexts, but the people who use it always do it for the same reasons. Because they're stubborn, weak, and afraid. Embrace your fallibility. Don't cling to weak evidence just because you want to believe something, and don't spread it because you'll feel better of others have beliefs as weak as you. Adapt, learn, grow. Believe in things because they have a rigorous foundation on reason and evidence. Believing in something because of anything else is called delusion.\n","date":"Mar 4, 2019, 11:37 AM"},{"content":"2680 - wow so we’re just gonna argue about Bernie here for the next 18 months aren’t we\n","date":"Mar 4, 2019, 11:37 AM"},{"content":"2679 - why does no one ever pick me\n","date":"Mar 4, 2019, 11:37 AM"},{"content":"2678 - i miss my dogs.\n","date":"Mar 4, 2019, 11:37 AM"},{"content":"2677 - Would anyone who has done the Dublin summer politics program be down to talk about their experience in the program?\n","date":"Mar 4, 2019, 11:37 AM"},{"content":"2676 - Fuck every presidential candidate, vote for nip chafing on #chafesmynips2020\n","date":"Mar 3, 2019, 11:01 PM"},{"content":"2675 - you know what really chafes my nips? increased friction between my nipples and the fabric of my shirt when I'm running\n","date":"Mar 3, 2019, 11:01 PM"},{"content":"2674 - Honestly nothing chafes my nips more than the fact that I still can’t figure out where the sound between Caswell and MacMillan comes from\n","date":"Mar 3, 2019, 11:01 PM"},{"content":"2673 - Can people not be loud right outside of the absolute quiet zone of the rock there’s an entire campus for you to chat and yell and make noises thanks\n","date":"Mar 3, 2019, 11:01 PM"},{"content":"2671 - advisors for econ/bio or econ/neuro double concentration?\n","date":"Mar 3, 2019, 11:01 PM"},{"content":"2670 - While having my classes canceled is welcome, my CAPS appointment for tomorrow, which I need quite urgently, is now canceled as well.\n","date":"Mar 3, 2019, 11:01 PM"},{"content":"2669 - sidewalks are made for people to go up and down both directions – that means when you see someone walking toward you, yall groups of 3 and 4 need to SKOOT and form a fucking line so others can go down the street. this is not a vacation destination disneyland bitch. \n\nMOVE OVER.

It takes so much to accept that your own body has been violated like that, to tell yourself that and to tell your friends that.

Your darling Hillary Clinton was a white supremacist back in the 60s, and has continued to say obviously racist things since then (calling black teenagers “superpredators” and telling a group of black males that she relates to them because she “also likes watermelons” - the second instance was literally during her 2016 campaign). Joe Biden has called Mike Pence a decent guy, and Kamala Harris has made a career off of throwing young people of color in jail.

I need to find this out for a project in my independent research lab. It came up in discussion and I wanted some more perspective. Here is one outlook on the issue but I was truly hoping to hear some contrarian views:\n\nBeing a liquid, water is not itself wet, but can make other solid materials wet.\n\nWetness is the ability of a liquid to adhere to the surface of a solid, so when we say that something is wet, we mean that the liquid is sticking to the surface of a material.\n\nWhether an object is wet or dry depends on a balance between cohesive and adhesive forces. Cohesive forces are attractive forces within the liquid that cause the molecules in the liquid to prefer to stick together. Cohesive forces are also responsible for surface tension. If the cohesive forces are very strong, then the liquid molecules really like to stay close together and they won't spread out on the surface of an object very much. On the contrary, adhesive forces are the attractive forces between the liquid and the surface of the material. If the adhesive forces are strong, then the liquid will try and spread out onto the surface as much as possible. So how wet a surface is depends on the balance between these two forces. If the adhesive forces (liquid-solid) are bigger than the cohesive forces (liquid-liquid), we say the material becomes wet, and the liquid tends to spread out to maximize contact with the surface. On the other hand, if the adhesive forces (liquid-solid) are smaller than the cohesive forces (liquid-liquid), we say the material is dry, and the liquid tends to bead-up into a spherical drop and tries to minimize the contact with the surface.\n\nWater actually has pretty high cohesive forces due to hydrogen bonding, and so is not as good at wetting surfaces as some liquids such as acetone or alcohols. However, water does wet certain surfaces like glass for example. Adding detergents can make water better at wetting by lowering the cohesive forces . Water resistant materials such as Gore-tex fabric is made of material that is hydrophobic (water repellent) and so the cohesive forces within the water (liquid-liquid) are much stronger than the adhesive force (liquid-solid) and water tends to bead-up on the outside of the material and you stay dry. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to define the term \"wet.\" If we define \"wet\" as the condition of a liquid sticking to a solid surface, such as water wetting our skin, then we cannot say that water is wet by itself, because it takes a liquid AND a solid to define the term \"wet.\"\n\nIf we define \"wet\" as a sensation that we get when a liquid comes in contact with us, then yes, water is wet to us.\n\nIf we define \"wet\" as \"made of liquid or moisture\", then water is definitely wet because it is made of liquid, and in this sense, all liquids are wet because they are all made of liquids. I think that this is a case of a word being useful only in appropriate contexts.\n\nLet me know in the comments!\n","date":"Mar 3, 2019, 1:03 PM"},{"content":"2616 - I've now been ghosted by two guys in AAAARRRcapella.

On October 2014, two female students who were at a Lantern party, had their drinks spiked by a date rape drug called GHB. One of them was raped later that night by two Phi Psi members. Although an abundance of evidence supported their claims initially, the charges against the two male students were later dropped, arguably because one of the accused was the son of a member of the Board of Trustees. The Brown community was justifiably outraged and social media campaigns were launched using #MoneyTalksAtBrown and #GHBGetOutOfRapeFree to voice this.\n\nThis may have been almost 5 years ago, so you may think that it is time to forgive and forget. But ask yourself this- does the story of the survivor, does her pain, her sleepless nights, the exhaustion of narrating her story over and over again- to lawyers, administrators and hearing panels, and most of all the trauma of the night itself cease to be any less valid today than it was in October 2014? Will she ever get back the life she had before that night? Is it not disregarding her trauma and invalidating her experience to acknowledge the existence of an underground Lantern House- the community that stood by her assailants and chose to believe their story over hers? After all that's the only semblance of justice she has ever received- the administration's dissolution of the fraternity that served her a spiked drink. And we know how rare it is for the administration to take action against institutions monopolised by rich white people so we can assert with near certainty that Phi Psi was responsible for the drugging. Even her assailants were let off scot free because they were kids of wealthy Brown corporation members. \n\nSo if you have even a semblance of empathy for survivors, and believe me, you should, don't go to Lantern, ask your friends to not rush Lantern, and tell the folks in Lantern that their brotherhood is tainted with the blood of an unforgivable crime. Lantern members raped somebody. How can you willingly want to fit into a crowd that desires to perpetuate the legacy of Phi Psi- which is inseparable from its tainted history- more than they respect a woman's body and her right to consent? How can you want to flaunt your position as a member of a community whose sheer existence is the negation of a survivor's story and a denial of justice to all who have been assaulted?\n\nIt scares me to think of how short institutional memory is. Two years ago campus was aflame with indignation at the university's unjustifiable excusal of the two rapists from Lantern. They were outraged that a house that was meant to create community and friendship at Brown, had instead aided and abetted rape, and had stood by its two guilty members who were pardoned by their wealth and privilege. Now we flock to Lantern parties every weekend because they're so much fun. \n\nI went to Lantern frequently too, until I was raped. You can do better. Do better.\n","date":"Mar 3, 2019, 10:43 AM"},{"content":"2600 - have not hooked up w someone in over a yr how do i get over that\n","date":"Mar 3, 2019, 10:43 AM"},{"content":"2599 - The dear blueno reading honestly slapped . . . !!\n","date":"Mar 3, 2019, 10:43 AM"},{"content":"2598 - The dear blueno reading was better than coke in my ass\n","date":"Mar 3, 2019, 10:42 AM"},{"content":"2597 - I saw you two kissing and it was cute\n","date":"Mar 3, 2019, 10:42 AM"},{"content":"2596 - Very true, shitty weather makes it that much harder.

The pressure of finding a job, especially coming from an abusive/dysfunctional family, is the worst. I would also self harm when my interviews went badly, because I'd think that I was a failure and worthless - something that my family would agree with if I come back empty handed. I don't really know if there's a solution, but I've found that being able to talk to people and find people who have been through your situation is a sort of functional coping mechanism. This probably isn't the answer you want to hear, but I would suggest considering seeing a therapist to talk through some of the feelings and thoughts regarding your situation. It took me over a year to finally seek help, and it's not as though everything has been magically cured, but sometimes it's just nice to have someone remind me that if I'm not as worthless as I think, despite what my family might say. As for your friends - it shouldn't be a burden if they are your true friends. They probably don't understand and will most likely not be able to understand, just because they've never been in that situation. It is possible to let them know that even though they don't understand/aren't sure what to say, as long as you know they're here for you, that's what matters. What I mean by this is - you can preface situations sometimes by saying something like \"I really just need to rant\" or \"I just need to know you're here for me\" (as corny as that is). Sometimes having friends listen, even if they don't really understand, might be just enough.

It has been the hardest and most wonderful four years of my life, and it’s made me into the person I am today. But one way in which Brown has failed me (and I have failed myself) is in perpetuating the “echo chamber” syndrome. I know that people at Brown tend to be like-minded and share similar values (such is the nature of an Ivy League), but I refuse to believe that there is one single rhetoric which pervades every single issue here. \n\nWhen did we stop listening to each other, if what the other person is saying does not match up with everything we already believe to be true? When did we start equating opinions to facts? When did we let confirmation bias take the place of nuanced discussion?\n\nI feel the need to justify this by saying, yes, I’m a liberal, yes I’m a democrat, yes, I believe X, Y, and Z. But I find it extremely saddening to think that, at 22 years old, I have learned enough, experienced enough, to be set in my values.\n\nLast semester, in a Senior Seminar, 2 of my peers dropped out because they had different opinions than the majority of us. Many students were happy about this, but I thought it was so sad. In doing that, we created an exclusive, self-entitled, and frankly, re-affirming space that only led to superficial discussion. Hence, the echo chamber.\n\nAnd now, with the conversations about the Granoff dinners, I’m seeing the same thing. One dialogue, one side, one rhetoric. Great, let’s talk about the income inequality that pervades this campus- but how do we move the discussion beyond just pointing fingers and targeting people? How do we create space for diversity of opinion and nuanced discussion on important issues? \n\nWe remember to speak, but forget to listen. We’re so young, we have so much to learn.

For context:\nhttps://www.brown.edu/campus-life/events/student-activities/spring-weekend-policy\n\nIn past years, Wriston has been a place for many students to come party before the concert. While obviously the university cannot condone underage drinking, banning drinking events from happening on Wriston will only move these people to off-campus locations. Beyond being significantly less fun (at least in my opinion), off-campus parties are considerably less safe and inclusive for students. It's much more difficult to prevent sexual assault and overdrinking when students are spread out all over College Hill. It's also much more difficult for EMS to respond to calls across residential neighborhoods. If students don't have a central location to drink, it also could encourage more binge drinking/hard drug use inside or right before the concert. Brown's SAO is clearly more focused on avoiding liability than on protecting its students. This is particularly ironic given that Yale is facing a lawsuit for this exact policy:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/us/yale-fraternities.html\n\nRather than actively banning the largest parties in the hopes that students will suddenly and miraculously decide to forgo drinking and partying on Spring Weekend, Brown's SAO should be concerned with facilitating a safe and inclusive party culture. For example, they could provide on-call staff on the perimeters of the quads to ensure safety. They could also work with frats and srats to encourage drinking in moderation (allowing beer and wine instead of hard liquor, for instance). Part of Wriston's appeal is that it provides an open and accessible place for students to congregate, making their and the university's lives a lot easier. The university shouldn't kid themselves into thinking that getting rid of Wriston parties is serving any purpose other than preventing them the hassle of engaging with the problems of Brown's party culture. \n\nThank you for coming to my TEDTalk.\nUpdated Feb 27, 2019, 3:54 PM\n","date":"Feb 27, 2019, 3:54 PM"},{"content":"2472 - Could the girls who keep laughing during the Investments I afternoon class please stop?

This started during puberty when I stopped being mistaken (recognized?) for a girl and is just sort of around now. It also manifests as negative emotions whenever people describe me as male, use he/him pronouns, use the wrong name, or treat me as male in some other way. These feelings can vary from annoyance to anger but it’s usually sadness and also shame for some reason. \n\nThis is all kind of odd because I can’t really explain why it is that I want to be a girl or what exactly that would entail. Like, do I want to do traditionally feminine stuff, sometimes (ok a lot of the time), but that doesn’t feel like it explains the wrongness. I think it’s probably mostly social as I seem to strongly dislike things about my body because they are socially defined as masculine and that feels deeply wrong to me? I’m not sure whats wrong with me to make me feel that way though. I’m also not sure how much this has to do with attraction or sexuality. Like, it could be 100% that and I’m just not able to see it from the inside but, like, at this point I’m not even sure who I’m attracted to because I can’t figure out a way to imagine myself in any sort of relationship or having sex as I am now. Looking good in a traditionally feminine way might be nice but it’s not the goal and it feels nowhere near as pressing as the wrongness.\n\nI can’t tell you why any of this is. If I could stop feeling this way I would because it would probably make my life a lot easier. Unfortunately, I tried that and it turns out that’s super not how this works, at least for me. Anyway this is all probably a pretty unhealthy view to take about oneself. In my case it has led to a sort of unproductive hopelessness interspersed with impotent rage and harm directed at my body. I have been able to alleviate this only by taking steps to transition which is why I suspect it’s the right thing to do despite the fact that it’s just really super scary. Like, I don’t know if this experience counts as dysphoria or if I technically count as a girl, or if I’m even trans, or if I’m just crazy or what. Still, acting as though I am trans is the only way I’ve found to stave off the darkness so that’s what I’m doing.\n\nAnyway that was super long and I’m sorry about that. Hope this helps?\n","date":"Feb 27, 2019, 3:53 PM"},{"content":"2470 - What’re the rules for being fwb with a grad student in a dept you’ll never take classes in\n","date":"Feb 27, 2019, 3:53 PM"},{"content":"2469 - I’m just so glad that the Buxton house is becoming an Asian/ Asian American program house!!

Something like, \"\"Dear Auntie so-and-so, My wife says she's so overwhelmed at work and with chores around the house but I also work and can't find a way to communicate just how exhausting my responsibilities are too,\"\" blah blah blah you get the picture. I thought Dear Bueno was supposed to be the more democratic version of that where instead of the advice you get being limited solely to the perspective of one person, it'd be the conglomerate result of a bunch of people with different perspectives and thus different solutions, the best pro of that being that you get to choose what path you wanna take from various options depending on what you feel would work best for you.\nThe problem is that Dear Bueno isn't this. Most posts these days focus on issues of a systemic nature and often tackle them with a toxic tone that ends up with no satisfying conclusions or even polite disagreements in some cases. Now, I'm not saying we shouldn't have conversations on these incredibly complex topics, but I am saying we shouldn't have them here. Not on a page whose title and foundation rests on something much more personal. I miss the posts about students talking about how lonely they feel or how they sometimes struggle with their homesickness or how they need advice on how to navigate expressing their identity in front of their extremely conservative parents. Where did those posts go? Of course, you could argue that even the most personal issues are nothing but indicative of societal problems that have a much wider scope, but the thing is that most posts these days aren't even personal. They're not about \"\"I\"\"s or \"\"We\"\"s or even \"\"You\"\"s. The subjects of the sentences are no longer people but actions, institutions, - isms. These problems, these problematic aspects of our society, won't be solved in one or any finite number of Facebook posts. But something like, \"\"How do I better understand my Jewish girlfriend even though I'm Christian\"\" can or at least has a much better shot than the issue of antisemitism as a whole. Of course, we should still have a space to talk about these more complex issues, so maybe another FB page is appropriate. Maybe we could call it \"\"Blueno's Lamp\"\" (because it's supposed to shed light on these problems and enlighten the people who experience them or even the people who contribute to them).

The dinner was strange. Great food. I was too timid to attempt to get a glass of wine at what by all appearances was a university event. I deeply regret that.\n\nThere was not assigned seating but at least one person who worked for Brown sat at every table. More than a few of those Brown employees, including the one who sat at my table, worked in the Advancement Office. The purpose of this dinner, it soon became very apparent, was to start greasing the wealthy students early so as to build long and deeply profitable donor relationships once we graduated.\n\nI do know students who have asked for and received favors from Granoff (including but not limited to Reslife related stuff), though for many of the students who attended that dinner, Granoff was but one of several connections they could call upon to make such a request.\n\nI did not hear Granoff make any remark any where near as comical as the ones the article quoted—his invocation of a marriage stemming from a connection made at one of the dinners makes the whole affair sound like a sort of Birthright Trip for rich people. That being said I 100% believe he said what he is quoted as saying.\n\nThe Granoff Dinners are not the only events of this sort. There is also the a cocktail party hosted by a billionaire family held at the same restaurant every parents weekend. Separate events for wealthy incoming first years and their parents are held right before orientation. The invite list for all of these events have a lot of overlap.\n\nThese events are Brown at its worst. Brown should be ashamed of the fact that it has the least amount of socio-economic diversity in the Ivy League, much less even coming close to being representative to the actual US population. Brown is an elitist institution that serves as a lavish four year long summer camp for the wealthy.\n\nBrown—and every top school—has always been a place one can buy their way into. It has always sent a vastly disproportionate number of acceptance letters to graduates of elite high schools, and at least in my elite high school, nearly every one of those acceptance letters came with either a dollar tag attached or a healthy connection to someone the University deems \"\"important not to upset.\"\" But it has gotten worse over just the past 2 years. This is anecdotal, but significantly more kids have been getting into Brown from at least some elite NYC high schools in the past 2 years than they used to.\n\nThe last thing Brown should strive to do is try to \"\"foster a community\"\" among the wealthy. For one, there already is a community. Wealthy kids come to Brown already knowing other wealthy kids they went to high school with and through family connections and camp and so on. We enter this school with a social network—as evidence by the degree to which everyone already knew each other at the Granoff Dinner.\n\nSo many keep that social network socio-economically segregated in often unintentional but very precise ways. If you can't afford to come to dinner with the group, then I guess we'll just have to bond without you. If you don't have a story from Nikki Beach, what do we have to talk about? If you don't feel comfortable watching others mindlessly spend hundreds (or more) dollars in a single day, then that is something *you* should work on. Find your own spring break plans if you can't afford ours. This socio-economic segregation is then institutionalized in fraternities and sororities and program houses with extravagantly high dues and cultures of wealth.\n\nLet's not make excuses for the university. While our endowment may be paltry by Ivy League standards, we are still one of the richest institutions in the world. Brown could get by just fine without the extra $10 million a Granoff dinner attendee might throw in down the line. And to any donor reading this and scoffing, if you want your money to have even a modicum of an impact, try giving to a struggling community college or state school whose budget has been decimated over the past two decades.\n\nI came out of the dinner confused and upset. It is one thing to know about the privilege I as a person from a wealthy family have in the abstract. It is one thing to know about all the indirect advantages I have had stemming from that (excellent schooling since pre-K, tutors galore, never having to worry about hunger or other necessities, access to mental health services, etc). It is another thing to see that privilege laid bare in such a concrete way. It may seem naive, but even as a beneficiary of every lever of power this country has to pull, I did not think the levers of power worked in such blatant ways. It is the difference between knowing money sways politics and catching a politician stuffing the ballot box.\n\nWhat does it mean to me to have attended this dinner? It means I was complacent in all of this. I told my friends about its absurdity, but I did not write an Op-Ed for the BDH or try to do any sort of mass awareness raising activity.\n\nIf you ask me if I attended the Granoff dinner, I will deny it. And I would have done so even before this dinner came out. I cary a certain amount of shame with me about coming from a wealthy background. I am a fervent believer that wealth is inherently incriminating—it only occurs through greedily accumulating far more than one needs and can only be maintained by turning a blind eye to need and inequity all around. Coming from a wealthy family is out of my control (as is my family's wealth). I try my best not to appear as though I am particularly well off. And I think many from a similar background do as well. I do think this is better than blatant flaunting of wealth, but it does contribute to an insidious culture of secret wealth where those who lack wealth never feel like they quite belong, though they are less certain of why exactly that is.\n\nThough the dinners should of course stop, the dinners are not the problem. Brown being an institution that caters to the wealthy enabling the recreation and perpetuation of vast inequities seeded into this country is the problem. The dinners are just a symptom of that and the dinners going away won't change that.\n","date":"Feb 26, 2019, 8:11 PM"},{"content":"2424 - girls who leave masses of hair displayed on the shower walls: why? weird flex but ok congrats on going fucking bald i guess?\n","date":"Feb 26, 2019, 8:10 PM"},{"content":"2423 - If anyone plays guitar/banjo/violin/anything else and wants to play some bluegrass jams comment below\n\n- a lonely mandolin player\n","date":"Feb 26, 2019, 8:10 PM"},{"content":"2422 - I'm fine, I'm okay, who needs self-esteem anyway?\n","date":"Feb 26, 2019, 8:10 PM"},{"content":"2421 - Don’t let this Granoff shit distract you from the fact that millions of men are being circumcised without their consent.\n","date":"Feb 26, 2019, 8:10 PM"},{"content":"2420 - CW: Sexual content, classism\n\nDraco glared at Harry. “What were you and your friends thinking, sneaking into the party like that?!

After all—I also couldn’t bear the thought of losing you…”\n\nHarry’s angry expression softened at that. “Listen Draco. If it’s the right thing to do, then it doesn’t matter if it’s hard. And speaking of hard things, I have something for you.” With that, Harry whipped out his massive, uncircumcised penis. “Eleven inches. Nice and supple.”\n\nDraco dropped to his knees as he hungrily stared at Harry’s cock. Grabbing the shaft of Harry’s massive member with his pale, smooth hands, Draco ran his forked tongue along the top of Harry’s penis. Tongue bifurcation, along with circumcision, were both longstanding traditions amongst London’s old wizarding families. Even if it had hurt at the time, he had long since forgotten the pain. However, even though neither body modification had ever really bothered him, he kind of wished that he had been given a say in the matter—after all, it was his body. Still, the forked tongue meant that he could do this. He peeled back Harry’s foreskin and split his tongue along either side of the frenulum. Flicking his tongue up and down like a true blue-blooded Slytherin, he elicited a series of increasingly intense groans from Harry. \n\nSuddenly, Harry let out a different kind of groan. There was a sharp pain in his scar—something he had only felt when he was sharing dreams with Voldemort. All of a sudden, his surrounding dimmed and began to shift. He was seeing double, Draco’s blonde hair blending in and out of focus with a dark antechamber. Worse, he knew that Voldemort was seeing the same thing. “Draco,” he hissed. “He’s here. Voldemort.” He lost control of his vocal cords. A raspy voice that didn’t belong to him came out. “Now. What do we have here?”\n\nDraco sat up in a panic, his throbbing erection becoming even harder in the process. “Harry! I mean my lord! I can explain!”\n\n“No need to worry, my boy. I know that the Malfoys are as loyal as they come—and from what I can see, you’re a natural at the latter. Also, do away with the formalities—you boys can call me Marty. Now, don’t mind me.”\n\nWith that, Harry felt the pain bleed out his scar. At the same time, he ejaculated all over Draco, who was still gawping at the unexpected turn of events. Feeling that the mood was ruined, both boys awkwardly bid each other farewell for the night. Harry suddenly felt that something wasn’t right. “Wait, Draco!” he shouted. Draco paused. Harry gestured to the evidence of their midnight tryst on the plush carpet. “How are we going to clean up this mess?” \n\nDraco snorted. “Don’t worry, the cleaning staff will get it.”\n\nHarry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “Draco, we’re wizards for crying out loud. And you’re going to make the cleaning staff clean this mess up? For all you talk about purebloods being superior, it doesn’t seem like you know much about treating people properly.” With that, he angrily pulled out his other eleven inch wand (the holly and phoenix feather one) and promptly cleaned up the mess. Then, he turned on his heel, leaving Draco feeling sorry for himself in the corridor. \n\nVoldemort sat back, looking pleased. Looks like making the boy his horcrux was the right move after all.\n\n“Harry, you know I’m always watching.”\n","date":"Feb 26, 2019, 8:10 PM"},{"content":"2419 - Does anyone have good notes or recordings of the Abnormal Psychology lectures?

But Brown actively maintaining a hierarchical structure against and a sense of entitlement over lesser privileged kids within Brown is beyond wrong. Not “a little unfair but that’s the way the world works”, it’s morally wrong. These kids should feel equal to the Granoff invitees given basic principles of human dignity. But since Brown caters to the 1%, I’ll make an argument for them: being in an environment for once in your life where you are not better than your peers, where you are not more capable, where you do not have more rights (for better housing or otherwise), where you do not have a leg up over the person sitting next to you is a necessary experience to have in order to function in a civilized society. In my opinion, the lack of these experiences is why America is where it’s at now politically. It’s why socialism is a dirty word here. Wealth may help you, it may privilege you, it may entitle you, but it does not make you more worthy. It does not intrinsically distinguish you from the rest, it does not gift you with more human dignity. These dinners make all the other things on this campus make sense: unexplained housing miracles, international houses that perpetuate elitism, classist organizations and clubs. I love Brown, I love the students (of all the percents!), and I feel more ashamed knowing such a wonderful community has been letting this shit lurk in the shadows.

Isn't privilege like a Ponzi scheme? There is always going to be someone poorer/ more oppressed than you. So compared to someone else, everyone is privileged. So, I guess what gives some people the right wave it around and others not?\n","date":"Feb 26, 2019, 8:07 PM"},{"content":"2407 - Not trying to defend or attack the dinner's, but I simply wanted to address the fact that I feel that many of the posts here are showing a bit of mob mentality in their sentiments. It seems to me as though many people here have a somewhat unrealistic view of the functionality of society (or at least aren't considering it), although I am fully aware that at least half the people here would prefer if we took a sharp pivot to socialism ASAP.\n\nThe gist of my message/rant here is that life is not fair, which is a sad truth. It would be ideal if everyone could always get what they desire (or deserve) but this is neither the way things are nor the way things should be. Some people will always be getting the invites while others do not. In this case, the hard work of parents has led to great opportunity for their offspring, which is a major incentive for people to work hard in society. It seems as though many people on this page constantly say that equal opportunities should be extended to all without realizing that this is impossible. If everyone could take whatever opportunities they choose, what would be the point of working, learning, being friendly, or anything else that you don't want to do. Of course this is taking what you all are saying to an extreme, and I know that this is not your vision, although I am interested to hear what is.\n\nHowever, to get back to my point, life isn't fair and it hasn't been from the moment each and every one of us was conceived. Some people are blessed with opportunities that others are not given and that is a fact of life. What they do with these opportunities is up to them. I would hope that our society is one that encourages each and every individual to take advantage of all of the resources that they have in order to leave the greatest impact on the world that they can.\n\nI think it is also important to remember that although many at Brown don't consider themselves to be privileged at all, everyone here is in a way. Just because you are here means that you have been given opportunities that others have not. No matter what your background is I can guarantee that there is someone else out there who is worse off. Now this is not to say that if you came from a low socioeconomic background that you didn't have to work harder and overcome more obstacles than others. Nobody gave you the opportunity to go to Brown, you earned it through and through, but without certain things happening in your life you never would have had this opportunity. This therefore makes you technically \"\"privileged\"\" over folks who did not have the same chance and had a harder path or even no way at all to achieve acceptance to a university such as Brown. I want to be clear that I don't mean any privileges that were earned, but rather random/lucky occurrences that have been beneficial in some way, whatever they may be. This is hard for me to think about but its important in trying to realize that all of us should be aware of the advantages and the disadvantages that we have faced.\n\nDespite the great cognitive dissonance that I'm sure this will incite, I ask that those of you who are condemning people who attend dinners or just those who come from top socioeconomic backgrounds as a whole to consider this: Attending Brown University is invite only, there are many who would like to attend and are not given the opportunity, and Brown is meant to be a place where students who attend can collaborate ideas and network. Sounds a bit familiar. Yet, everyone on this page attends Brown anyway. You did not protest then and give up your acceptance just because not everyone was given the opportunity you were granted. You took this opportunity and are currently attempting to make the best of it, as anyone would hope that you do because the people here truly have potential to change the world. Sure, it is undeniably true that you do not have the advantages that some do, but it is also true that you do have (and utilize) advantages that others lack. This is how society essentially has to function in order to be efficient, people must strive to do the best with what they've got. It's not fair, but it's a natural law.\n\nNow, obviously there are plenty of qualms with the recent revelations that I believe to be justified. Classism is very real, the growing income inequality in this country is absurd, class mobility is too low, and the playing field should be more fair. I don't want to appear as though I am brushing these aside, I just don't know how but these issues certainly need to be addressed. However, I just needed to say that a level playing field (equal opportunity for everyone) is not feasible, and condemning people for simply utilizing the resources that they've got is illogical, irrational, and hypocritical. Everyone does it.\n","date":"Feb 26, 2019, 8:07 PM"},{"content":"2406 - To all the people outraged about the Granoff Dinner: \n\n1. WHY are people so surprised that this is a thing? We go to one of the oldest and most privileged institutions in the world and with the rich history and legacy that comes with going here, also comes the fact that we mingle with some of the people who have had ties to this place forever. Just about every elite institution has some form of institutionalized elitism that seems to add to the allure of being a top school. We all are here for our own reasons but to be honest, exclusive student groups, clandestine societies and even the finals/ dining clubs at Harvard, Princeton, Oxford, Cambridge, etc... have been long standing traditions that still continue to this day. Yes, life's not fair, but methods of grooming the top 1% have always been right under our noses so it's unfair to act like all hell broke loose over a dinner series\n2. With regards to CPAX's email and Brown providing logistics- although it may seem \"\"shocking\"\" to the eyes of some, it is perfectly reasonable that an institution would want to advance it's endowment and standing by captivating and treating the people who have been regular patrons with a little extra care. A $9000 dinner could eventually make exponential returns to the ways that these groups of individuals will eventually donate. Colleges are BUSINESSES and Brown survives on endowments and gaining returns from these groups. Just about every privately owned institution has perks for the \"\"regulars\"\" . Think... rewards club. \n3. Honestly can't tell if most of these memes and \"\"fake Granoff counter dinners\"\" are jokes or an expression of the already insurmountable level of angst that people show towards anything remotely unfair. Most people who get invited to these things can't help it and honestly, someone in their family worked to amass the status so that these individuals can enjoy these privileges. Yes it's unwarranted to give certain groups this privilege, but once again- life's not a level playing ground. Expecting someone else with more privileged to give up their privilege because it makes you uncomfortable makes no sense. \n4. Getting invited to one opulent dinner makes no-one less or more deserving of being here. We are all here because we deserve to be in one way or another and a dinner should NOT be triggering this level of surprise in people. Not every space will be yours and exclusive events such as these happen all the time.

I am an international student who did not go to a UWC, and my family and I are struggling like hell with loans, part-time jobs and I have no institutional support whatsoever. I am aware that many of these UWCers would have no fighting chance studying in the US, and for this the Davis scholarship deserves respect for creating some semblance of economic diversity among the international population.

I was assigned male at birth. I use they/them pronouns.\n\nFirst, I have to agree with you that dysphoria is pretty confusing and even as a trans person I don't fully understand what it is. For me, it's a recurring feeling that this can't possibly be the body I'm going to live in forever. Very often when I picture the future I picture living in a \"\"woman's body\"\" (i.e. boobs, vagina, no body hair). There are some days when I just KNOW I am a woman, the same way I imagine you just know you are a man. On such days, I find even they/them pronouns off-putting, because clearly I should be using she/her. These have also been the days that I've come the closest to announcing my transness to the entire world (I'm only out at Brown), and asking my doctor to begin transitioning.\n\nFor me, this feels different from other bodily desires because most other bodily desires I have are either things I'd want to change for my own purely aesthetic purposes (like dying my hair) or in order to make myself more attractive to others (like losing weight - another body image thing which is its own can of worms!). Combatting gender dysphoria and a desire to transition feel more like things I would do solely for myself and solely to make my life more livable. \n\nBut then there are days when I feel fine in my body and when random people who don't know me misgender me, I don't feel weird about it. I've had days when I can picture myself living as a man. It's also strange because I am almost exclusively attracted to men, and I find the conventionally attractive male body desirable, and I sometimes have trouble separating the body I want in a partner from the body I want for myself. Dysphoria-wise, these are the days I find the easiest but the most logically confusing lol. \n\nAnyway, I don't think I experience dysphoria as seriously as some other trans people, and simply acknowledging my transness to myself and keeping in the back of my mind that if I need to, I can transition one day, has made me feel better about a lot of it. I think it's because I no longer need my body to tell me I'm not a man. \n\nLike you, I also wonder how much of this would still be true for me if our society didn't have gender roles to begin with. I have no idea but also we don't live in such a society so I think it's irrelevant. \n\nI know this is super all over the place but I think dysphoria and its manifestations is super specific to each trans person because there is such a wide array of trans identities. Good on you for asking and please keep doing so! I wish more people would ask tbh because I don't think most cis people know anything about anything when it comes to gender.

I don't doubt if I can write code; I know I can, and for the most part given a quiet working environment and chunks of time that are more than 2 hours long, I can get a lot of shit done in that time.

Even in an article that was very clearly not a fan of him, he was quoted as saying \"\"I love to convince people that wealth distribution is significantly more attractive than wealth accumulation.\"\" Do you think he's doing this because he wants everyone there to be super rich and loves class division?\n\nThe dinner is, frankly, a glorified fundraiser. He brings rich people together, tries to get them to feel a connection to Brown, and pushes them towards feeling like they (or their parents) should donate when they graduate and become rich alum. I'm sure Brown is aware of this and thus is happy to plan it.\n\nHe does this in the way that is most likely to actually get through and have an effect on rich people.

I’ve only had real discussions about class at TWTP and with my UFLi-identifying friends. Brown Class Confessions is another student-led resource for privileged people to learn about how class may affect low SES students. As a senior I’ve witnessed that the “unofficial curriculum” at Brown can teach us a lot about power and privilege, but there’s a more pervasive culture of silence around class that exists for few other social stratifiers. \n\nTake for example a hypothetical white, cisgender, heterosexual, documented, male-identifying, able-bodied/neurotypical and generally WASP-y Brown student with massive socioeconomic privilege. (I’m sure a few of the Granoff attendees fit that bill.) If our hypothetical friend wants to learn about nearly all of the systems of oppression listed above, there are specific resources he can access that are provided as part of his Brown education. Where will he go to learn about his privileged role in the capitalist system? \n\nThis is not to say that I want that this hypothetical white guy to take advantage of identity spaces he doesn’t belong in. It is not the responsibility of the oppressed to educate the oppressor, but I do believe that it’s unethical for Brown to add to the next generation of the social and economic elite without giving its students a chance to interrogate their own relationship to power and privilege in the process of obtaining a Brown education. \n\nIf this unuversity is truly taking the task of ‘diversity and inclusion’, then it must also take the responsibility of educating those who can do harm.\n","date":"Feb 25, 2019, 10:44 AM"},{"content":"2340 - lmao @the guy in the corner of the ratty (2/25 morning) staring at his notebook and muttering \"I am so screwed\" over and over again\n","date":"Feb 25, 2019, 10:43 AM"},{"content":"2339 - To the people who destroyed all the exit signs in Emwool, why did you do that?

The problem is who is being shut out from those dinners and how all of the benefits of attending the dinners are reserved for people whose families already have tons of advantages. \n\nI come from a rural village in deep southern Louisiana. I, and tons of other students at Brown are taking on a ridiculous amount of debt with the hope that 4 years far away from our families, missing birthdays, births, and deaths, often without the funds and time to go home during breaks or long weekends, etc. will allow us to climb up the ladder and provide more opportunities for our children and/or future generations who actually need a helping hand and leave our mark in whatever we can with the advantages a Brown degree might give us.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich withhold amazing networking opportunities from first-gen and low-income students by only inviting themselves to fancy dinners when they really don't need all that much of a leg-up to climb just a little bit higher than the other 1%ers. \n\nI had never left the South before I came to Brown. When I got here, a shy, anxious guy, in clothes that didn't fit quite right, I felt (and still feel) so out of place next to all of the smartly dressed students here and their Canada Goose jackets. I felt so out of place being one of the few students in a class that couldn't raise their hands in a large Roman History class when the Professor asked who had ever been to Rome.\n\nI felt so, so out of place next to all of the students speaking so eloquently about the amazing life experiences they had in their 18 years that many generations of my family couldn't even compare with combined; being bound to the small tract of earth they slaved over for the ancestors of the rich white kids who would call me a n***** when my family gave up so much of their income to send me to the best schools they could manage in order to give me a better chance at success than they had. The closest my family might be able to get to the wonderful experiences some Granoff(esque) folks get in 18 years would be my great grandfather who fought in France during WWII because he spoke Creole so he could translate French for his higher ups. Despite his unique usefulness, they made him wear the American flag on his uniform upside down so no one would dare think he was equal to the white soldiers. And when he came back from the war, he spent the rest of his life sharecropping in the place he was born, never to leave it again. \n\nI was so in wonder at a classmate mentioning that they got a $32/hr internship back home after just their first year at Brown when I would see a family member of mine make *not even* that much as a registered nurse with years of experience, being denied entry into the houses of people she just wanted to keep alive on account of her nose and the color of her skin; experiencing backhanded compliments like “you’re so nice for a little n**** girl” when she would risk her life going into the KKK country of Catahoula, Louisiana. \n\nI'm in Classics (and History), Brown's oldest concentration, and when I got here I was struggling with Greek in large part because I didn't have the chance to attend any esteemed school that taught Greek or Latin even though I knew since my sophomore year of high school that I wanted to study ancient history. Luckily the Classics department at Brown is understanding of the fact that there are students who might come to Brown without having studied any of those languages but would still like to study Classics so there's a more forgiving track in the concentration for students like me who have to start from scratch. \n\nI'm planning on going to grad school and hoping to get tenure somewhere after that so that I can fight the good-fight within the academy as a queer man of color in a field that doesn't often see faces like mine. Even though the classics department has that extra track for students from backgrounds like mine; grad schools still have a clear preference for applicants who have completed the more advanced tracks which are virtually impossible to do unless you came to Brown already knowing Latin, Greek, and/or Sanskrit. My thesis advisor told me recently that I will most likely have to spend extra time and money that I don't have getting more experience in the languages before any grad school might consider accepting me. Yet another way that the system keeps out people who aren’t privileged enough to attend things like Granoff dinners; a suspiciously long standing “holdover” from the days when universities like Brown were places exclusively for wealthy white men to gather and keep making themselves richer which really seems more like a feature of the current system than a bug.\n\nI was personally very lucky to have an absolutely amazing advisor during my first year who really helped me transition into Brown. Yet... despite unanimous approval from the department, many letters in support of her from well known scholars in the field, and a *Yes* vote from the Tenure, Promotion, and Appointments Committee (TPAC)... despite all of those clear signs that she should have received the next level of tenure, Provost Locke overruled the TPAC’s decision. Thus, the rogue word of a lone white man jettisoned a woman from the department who was an absolute fighter for diversity and inclusion both in the department. Without her, I don't know if I would have been able to make it through my first semester here. Nor do I know how many other students like me she might have been able to help get through Brown. But I know that she is sorely missed everyday and I am enraged by the circumstances of her removal. And, unfortunately, there's a chance that the classics department might lose another voice that it most desperately needs in a time when white-supremacists and white identitarians use the ancient world to ignorantly “justify” their beliefs and their abuse of immigrants, women, Jews, LGBTQ folks, and other marginalized groups.\n\nThere's no buildings with my family's name on it, but my people built the buildings you put your names on. Yet, about 20% of any given class (see the relevant Providence Journal article) can be in the 1% but black students only get to be 6% of all of Brown's current undergrad population.\n\nRemember the walkout we had earlier this school year to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the walkout black students did in 1968? Brown lauds the 1968 walkout as a great moment of progress for the university yet has gone back on the *very few* concessions the university made to the protestors in '68 which the university blatantly refused to re-uphold when asked by students recently. However, the university did indeed rename a building after 2 black alums so that’s nice I guess. \n\nOn the side of the John Carter Brown Library are the words “Only the word transforms what happened into history.” As a black history concentrator, in a field in which I’m intimately acquainted with how loudly the voices of people who are not written down can scream; the words sting me every time I read them because I can suddenly hear the haunting voices of my people who thanklessly built this campus, this country, and gave so much of the fruit of their slave-sorrows in the art the entire world now appreciates yet simultaneously declares Africa devoid of culture and history when they erased so much of that history by killing or silencing the people who would’ve told that history; forgetting that they only have the letters to write down those “histories” because they initially came from an Afro-Semitic people, written on African Papyrus, and was preserved by African deserts and by Semitic scholars. \n\nSo look, we, various groups of people at Brown would love to have a shot at the opportunities you all have to make changes at Brown and in the wider world; and I will fight for those changes whether or not I get anything near your opportunities. While I have been lucky to have found a network of support at Brown (especially in female faculty and female faculty of color who so often do so much additional hidden labor that doesn’t get recognized); I know that in that way my situation isn’t that common and there are still many things they just can’t help me with that the opportunities you and other students have had simply by virtue of your births would have more access to better solutions. \n\nTl;dr: the rich just keep getting richer while the rest have to take on massive burdens just to MAYBE get the scraps that fall off the Granoff dinner tables. People... please check your privileges, especially about the things they allow you to not be upset by. Flint still doesn’t have clean water.\n","date":"Feb 25, 2019, 10:43 AM"},{"content":"2337 - I got invited to the Granoff dinner by mistake cause my name matches that of a building lol I should have gone\n","date":"Feb 25, 2019, 10:42 AM"},{"content":"2336 - Hey guys, I was just thinking maybe we should be nicer to the 1% and stop the wealth-shaming?

I did not receive off-campus permission until a few weeks before the Fall semester. The whole summer I tried desperately to get approved due to SEAS accommodations, and despite SEAS support, ResLife wouldn't budge and rather offered me insufficient on-campus options. After having my doctor call ResLife directly several times, I finally received permission. Originally, I thought this delay was due to ResLife staff resignations during the summer... I emailed staff of SEAS and ResLife to thank them so much, and one of Kate Tompkins' successors told me to stop by once I got back on campus and say \"Hi\", and I did. In short, I thanked them and they wanted to apologize for the delay. They then told me that they had been trying to fight for my and others' cases to move off-campus, but \"those with seniority\" would not budge. I was told that, unfortunately, many aspects of ResLife are and have been powerless puppets. This is one of the many reasons for the ResLife resignations last fall. Accordingly, I was told that Junior Year Off-campus permission is allocated to children/friends of donors, trustees, celebrities, politicians, the very wealthy, and anyone with power at Brown. Some spots are given to \"normal\" people through the lottery system and actually only to a few SEAS students with what Brown classifies as more severe disabilities. It doesn't end there, the same is with the normal on-campus housing lottery....Brown tries their best to hide it (recommending \"preferred\" and thus higher ranked lottery groups to put someone with a less recognizable last name as the Housing Leader, sometimes bypassing the lottery and placing groups before everyone else, etc.) Apparently, Brown does not want to \"fall down a slippery slope\" and grant excess permission to students since it means less housing revenue and, potentially, less meal-plan revenue due to more people cooking food off-campus. At the end of the day, the things I was told should not have surprised me. It has been well known that children/friends of the type I described above, have and continue to have preferential admission into this school; the preferential treatment does not stop at admission. The majority of these \"preferred\" student admits are not even legacies either. There are reasons why Brown has an interestingly high proportion of students coming from famous, wealthy, powerful, and legacy backgrounds. Perhaps conjecture, but I truly believe it is due to Brown being on a thirsty quest for money and an increased endowment stemming from intense competition from rival academic institutions, where it may be more difficult to wave the magic wand of $-USD and power as those peer schools are sometimes much more well known and sought after worldwide. The Granoff Dinners may be surprising, but are a rather inessential addition to Brown's historical and contemporary character. Brown has before looked the other way when children/friends of these individuals were caught cheating, assaulting, bullying, etc. etc. I am certain there are more secretive and more unimaginable things Brown supports, fosters, or lets happen. There is a very dark side to Brown...There is a cabal of privilege, power, and patrimony at Brown that cannot be governed since they themselves do the governing.\n","date":"Feb 25, 2019, 10:41 AM"},{"content":"2329 - I honestly love the discourse re: the Granoff dinners but tbh I'm not ready to move off the topic of circumcisions.

I'm male, with a 4:1 preference for girls over boys, meaning I would have to consider a guy extremely attractive to be aroused by them whereas I can be aroused by people I find less than extraordinary looking. But I've never felt like a boy. Specifically, I cannot describe what it feels like to be a boy. Being a boy to me just means having a penis and enjoying thrusting into things.

Although I’m sure the author of 2286 had only the best intentions, as someone who is low income, I find it unlikely that there was no instance when “socioeconomic divides separated people”. By default, without any sort of university funding or program, low income students are often socially separated from their higher income peers, whether or not the high income peers are aware of this segregation. Simply because of differences in experience and ability to find mutual activities that both groups can afford, there is already usually a division. Even if not coming with an elite attitude and willing to make friends with a low income peer, higher income students often say or act in insensitive ways which strain possible relationships with lower income peers, particularly in a group setting. Well-intentioned higher income students also sometimes say things that are hurtful when trying to support because of how much they “other” lower income people, including workers at this school. Even one on one, it can be hard emotionally for a low income student (at least for me, I don’t mean to be speaking for the entire low income community) to one minute have a conversation home and provide support to family and friends who may be struggling while hiding your own problems to not burden or disappoint, and the next minute put on a happy face and listen to Shannon complain to her friends about how she wanted to go to Paris instead of Italy for her birthday and how her mom is sending her the wrong color Canada goose. The she gets drunk and EMS’d the next day but faces no consequences because her mom thinks its “part of the college experience” and easily pays her hospital bill. And while this makes the low income student uncomfortable, the high income one is likely uncomfortable confronting their own privilege in interactions where the inequality between them is clear. So, naturally, it’s hard for a low income student to feel comfortable in a high income community where food, outings, clothes, and even conversations and past experiences are all built around wealth. \n\nThis is why we appreciate our own resilient, amazing, caring communities so much—a lot of us actually don’t WANT to be a part of your elite “social circle” and prefer our own circles. It just hurts that the school is actively funding this separation and giving even more money to those who already have it instead of the other way around. What do they need their “elite” dinners paid for when there are students on campus off meal plan who have to debate whether or not it’s worth it to buy dinner that night? Why do they need to further separate themselves from us within discrete organizations, “VIP dinners”, and separate housing? Don’t worry, our socioeconomic status is not contagious. You won’t catch anything if you run into us on campus or at a less elite event (because almost all events at Brown are elite to a certain level, since, well, it’s an ivy). You’re still in the safety of college hill, if the little crumb of “socioeconomic diversity” at Brown is really something to be afraid of these kids (as well as Brown admin who took part in this) need a huge reality check.\n","date":"Feb 25, 2019, 10:37 AM"},{"content":"2312 - I assume that you're mad about Granoff.

If anything, some of it seems misinformed, and whether intentional or not, a lot of it seems performative -- a way to signal that you care about low-income students or to get likes on some meme regardless of what the dinner actually says about Brown’s commitment to helping low-income students. \n\nI’ve laid out my thoughts on the matter below on why it strikes me that the outrage, and particularly the outrage at Brown, is misplaced. I obviously could be totally wrong here, so if you see something that doesn’t make sense or you disagree in some way, that’s totally valid, and I welcome any disagreements in the comment section. With that said, here’s what I think:\n\n1: I think we're all pretty well aware that without serious donations, Brown would be a much worse place than it already is for low-income students, and way fewer low-income students would be able to attend. (*1)\n\n2: If Brown really cares about inclusion, funding programs that help low-income students, and getting more low-income students to be able to attend, this means they have to get a lot more donations.\n\n3: One seemingly very effective strategy to do this is to have legacy admissions and cozy up to big donors. (*2)\n\n4: If all it takes for more low-income students to come to Brown and have the resources they need is for Brown to cozy up to rich people, this seems -- if a very sad indicator of the type of world we live in -- like a very good deal.\n\n5: I would rather Brown suck up to big donors, grant them some favors, mess with the housing lottery, and do logistics for their events, than for them to say no and have less funding. (*3)\n\n6: In conclusion, even though it feels yuck, it makes total moral sense for Brown to help Granoff plan and host an event. (*4)\n\nA lot of people have been saying that the dinner is bad, and Brown's involvement is bad, and that it shows that Brown doesn't really care about low-income students, equality, or inclusiveness. The above is why I don't think that's really all that fair.\n\nIn light of this, people might change their view to be that Brown's involvement with the dinner wasn't bad, but it shouldn't have been a secret and things should be more transparent. In response to that,\n\n1: Donors probably don't want Brown disclosing legacy information, or specifics about events like the Granoff dinner. (*5)\n\n2: If Brown said \"\"Hey, sorry, we don't care. If we let your kid in or help you with one of your events, we're telling everyone about it,\"\" they likely wouldn't donate or donate as much.\n\n3: This would mean less money for programs which directly affect low-income students.\n\n4: It's thus a choice between increased transparency and increased funds for Brown and programs which help low-income students. Honestly, I'm not sure what the prior really brings to the table, and it feels very Brown-esque performative, where getting behind it makes you sound like a good ally, but doesn't really do anything for low-income students. The latter thus feels like it makes more sense.\n\n5: In conclusion, while knowing this stuff happens was a downer, and it's all kind of yuck, Brown's choices in this matter seemed to make moral sense if it really cares about low-income students.\n\nFootnotes:\n*1: If you go online to the giving website, you can get some specific stats. Apparently keeping the Brown Promise around requires $72 million more, and Brown is trying to raise $500 million through Brown Together, specifically for financial aid. This doesn't include donations for things which specifically or seriously help first-gen and low-income students, like donations to the FLI center, donations that help the TA program run, which is vital for helping students who didn't go to the same rich prep schools and don't have as good of an academic background, as well as the numerous smaller programs like how Brown gives out free loaner laptops if you need them, which I imagine is funded by the Brown Annual Fund or CIS specific donations. Basically, donations (hundreds of millions of dollars worth) are vital for Brown to even maintain its current aid for low-income students, let alone expand it like it really needs to be doing.\n\n*2: One might be inclined to say “Yes, but there are other ways to get that money. I’d rather they not do this.” If there were other ways to get that money, then Brown could engage in them _and_ do this too. Brown badly needs more money for low-income students and financial aid, and it’s a yes/no choice between doing this and getting more money, or not doing this and missing out on what could have seriously helped with financial aid resources.\n\n*3: It sucks and I’d rather things like the housing lottery truly be equal, but even from just the public donations listed in the article, the guy’s given tens of millions of dollars to Brown, and the fact that Brown lets him do things like this probably makes him donate even more. It’s hard to argue that the sanctity of the housing lottery is worth more than tens of millions of dollars which go towards everything at Brown, and likely a good chunk of which goes towards financial aid and programs listed in 1.\n\n*4: Certainly, if I were Brown University, and he gave me tens of millions of dollars and then shot me an email just asking me to help him do logistics for an event, I’d have a hard time telling him no, regardless of whether I liked the event or stood for what it represented. Helping plan the event (especially seeing as they didn’t want to officially affiliate themselves with it or sponsor it) is not a ringing endorsement from Brown.\n\n*5: Not because they feel guilty about it or like they’re doing something wrong, but because I imagine they know the Brown community would either shit on them or their kid if everyone knew they were legacy. Already, just from this, we’ve seen a bunch of anti-Marty Granof posts, a ton of public disgust, and apparently, because of this, he’s been sent emails, texts, letters, and even had his son called, all of which I can only imagine had a similar tone to the article itself. Shouldn’t be too hard to see why they’d want to keep it hush even if they fully believed in what they were doing.\n\n(And honestly, while this post isn’t about whether Marty was right to throw this dinner or if he’s a good person, I want to take a personal aside and just say, What the fuck? Instead of just using all of his money for himself, this dude’s literally spent 10s, and maybe 100s of millions on this place. Not saying that makes him a stand up guy, and it’s fucked that we live in a society where people can even be that rich, but he’s obviously done a HUGE net-positive for this school and all of us, likely especially for those on financial aid. Some of the critique has been respectful, but some definitely hasn’t been -- can we not full-out shit on the guy who gave this much just so we could enjoy college more?)\n\nIn any case, it just feels like this article was fairly unsurprising, and the way that Brown deals with big donors is part of the reason that its able to offer what it currently does to low-income students. Feels a bit off to me to be outraged about it in the way that’s currently being seen.\n","date":"Feb 25, 2019, 10:36 AM"},{"content":"2309 - Anyone know where to buy some good asian tea leaves near campus?\n","date":"Feb 25, 2019, 10:36 AM"},{"content":"2308 - Why is everyone so surprised by the Granoff dinner article?

When I first received a Granoff dinner invitation, I was confused as to what it was. I Googled the phrase \"\"Granoff dinner\"\" to no avail; I talked to some other students, trying to figure out what it was, and eventually found others who also received an invitation. Of course, it readily became apparent that those who received invitations were of similar socioeconomic backgrounds as mine. I attended the dinner and, as promised in the email, it did turn out to be a fun evening. And yes, although most of the students present came from families who were well-connected, well-known, or both, I will contend that these dinners were never a closely held secret. While there was certainly a tacit understanding among attendees as to the reason they were at Bacaro on a Wednesday evening, there was never an expectation to hide the fact that it existed.\n\nMy impression has always been that these dinners were simply an extension of the Office of Advancement's strategies to solicit donations from wealthy alumni and parents. I take no issue with that, as donations are crucial to the university's operations; what I have always been baffled by, and believe that the ProJo article fails to resolve, is how and why certain students are invited to attend. Does Mr. Granoff or his staff personally handle the invitations, or does Brown's Office of Advancement recommend a list of students to be invited? A famous last name may guarantee you a seat, but this lack of transparency has been one of my main sources of unease.\n\nNo student at Brown is guaranteed an even playing field, and while the university has taken measures to level it somewhat, the fact remains that some students will have connections that make life easier for them. The dinners certainly exacerbate this disparity.\n\nAnd as for why the BDH has failed to report on this for so long, perhaps this should be discussed in relation to the fact that a non-zero number of editorial staff have been longtime attendees.\n","date":"Feb 25, 2019, 10:33 AM"},{"content":"2293 - @2270 ---- The most complex issue about this whole Granoff thing is the fact that some scholarships and facilities at Brown are made possible through gifts from the \"elite.\" Regardless, because you were born into a rich family does not mean you should have an upper-hand in admissions or connections to privilege.

I think what contributes to a lack of comments from non-jews condemning posts is that we see Jewish students have already commented and covered the bases. We see this on other posts about other issues too.\n\nWhat I think this roots back to is people of a community advocating for that community - those who are a part of a community are more likely to intervene; if someone is not in the community, they might not speak up even if they disagree with what is said. Examples: I don't often see my friends of wealth advocating for those who are low-income, though some do. I don't often see my Jewish friends speaking out on the injustices against Palestine, even though some do.

Just as important is the fact that even if you’re not doing anything bad with them, but you see him/ her doing something bad to others, don’t think you won’t be next. \n\nIn a psychology class, the term malignant narcissist was introduced to me. Fromm describes it as the personification of evil. I thought only Trump had it and that was the only one I was going to know about.

Any increase is legislative gun control or publicly affordable healthcare is fiercely fought against by the same. I don't know as much about border control issues. But for the other examples, the discrepancies you made are details, and most voters will know relatively little about the effects of such details. What they will be able to determine, is whether they think more kids should be well educated, or more people should be able to get healthcare, or if it's too easy to get guns and kill random people with it. These aren't complicated questions, yet they polarize the two major parties, and they are polarized about it very publicly. Someone who seriously considers deciding to favor one side over another to be a difficult decision is ignoring reality and their ability to inform themselves.\n\nBut more on what you were talking about. It's not \"\"evil\"\" to have impassionate or politically cautious views, of course. Nobody can know about every single issue. But when issues are so visible and ubiquitous in someones life, and they still decide to be dispassionate and avoid having any unweak opinions about them, that actually is bad. Being dispassionate just makes it easier for assholes to harm others. Dispassion helped Trump become president. Dispassion helped George Bush get reelected. Dispassion helped Nazis take control Germany. Dispassion helped the US treat colored people like shit for centuries. Dispassion is why coral reefs are dying, and why most people don't think that's a problem. This is why it's bad to enjoy ignorance, or to have weak opinions about problems in the world.

Male circumcision does not in any way, come close to the horror that is female genital mutilation. FGM affects millions of girls around the world. FGM is typically carried out on women without any kind of anesthetic and often under unsanitary conditions. The complications it leads to are endless, every time a woman so much as urinates or menstruates she undergoes unspeakable pain, not to mention the slew of infections and chronic diseases that she is now more prone to getting. And all that is also combined with the emotional/psychological trauma that comes with the process seeing as the procedure is typically carried out when a girl is at or near the age of maturity. It is a practice explicitly designed to control women and their sexuality that carries absolutely no health benefits. I agree that it is terrible that men get circumcised without their consent and yes, men should definitely get a say. But just the fact that some men do voluntarily opt into circumcision reveals that the two practices are really not on equal footing when it comes to the degree of trauma and pain they inflict.

I guess we’ve finally solved centuries of institutional racism. Your post displays a fundamental misunderstanding of the challenges faced by minorities. You can have all the diversity training and inclusion officers you want. That doesn’t do anything to change the fact that being a low-income and/or minority student in an extremely stressful CS class is a brutal experience. I guess it’s nice that you’re making an effort to be “inclusive” as a TA (whatever that means), but ultimately it will take a serious restructuring of the intro classes before all students can feel comfortable and confident. \n\nLook, obviously TAs are great people. I made that clear in my post. My point is that they aren’t helping to improve the system in the long term when they selflessly take on more and more exhausting work just to ease the burden on CS students, who still have a terrible workload even with help.\n\nAnd the idea that TAs are powerless is BS. Professors place an incredible amount of responsibility on the TA staff. TAs write and grade every homework, lab, and project.

As someone whose room looks directly out on it, it's a pretty shitty reminder upon waking up in the morning that a racist misogynist runs our country. Maybe you'd dispute that-- I think we can agree he has shown sympathy to racism, misogyny, and xenophobia-- KKK leaders think he's on their side... I understand the importance of free speech and political freedom, and that Brown can probably feel like a really hostile place for conservatives. And I would never do anything to take it down. I think to be posted I have to admire something--I guess I admire your boldness and conviction, and I wish you would be more empathetic to your peers. I admire the courage and strength of the freshmen who now see this flag every day.\n\nl hope whoever lives in that room reads this post and considers how it might make their neighbors feel. I feel pretty confident that whoever is hanging it is not adversely affected, threatened, or belittled by the president's rhetoric and policies, but so many people are and have to live under a government that they know doesn't value their identities. Not to mention the fact that we are at an institution of higher learning and the president routinely attacks the very idea of truth and knowledge and is now blatantly rejecting the constitution and separation of powers our country was founded on.\n\nI'm all for engaging in and expanding political conversation, but anonymously hanging the flag doesn't do much for furthering discourse at Brown or destigmatizing a political viewpoint and frankly doesn't attract much sympathy for your position. It does make people feel shitty on an everyday basis. Anyway, I hope, whoever you are, that you put some thought into what hanging that (huge, recognizable) flag in a highly visible spot in a freshman dorm means for someone who comes from a different background and faces different challenges than you, and if you can't figure it out or even imagine how they feel right now, I hope the next few years at Brown help with that.\n","date":"Feb 18, 2019, 4:00 PM"},{"content":"2012 - CMT friends get ready for a LIT week starting tonigghhhht!!!!\n","date":"Feb 18, 2019, 4:00 PM"},{"content":"2011 - Dear Blueno,\nim such a salty person. :\"(\n","date":"Feb 18, 2019, 3:59 PM"},{"content":"2010 - Just because you are ethnically from a certain country doesn’t necessarily mean you can be the voice of that country and make generalized, sweeping statements about their culture—especially when you haven’t even been there, you don’t speak the language, and your relationship with that country is only based on what your parents have told you (or what you have searched online). Your identity is valid, and your thoughts are valid, but when you speak or post about certain issues related to identity politics, it is important to qualify those views as yours only. For people who haven’t been to the country / place you are ethnically from, what you say and what you post about that place may be all they know or ever hear about it. If you don’t qualify your statements and emphasize that they reflect your opinion rather than what’s actually happening in that country, people might think that what you post is accurate (which for the record is not). I get that you want to get to know yourself and (your) culture more, as well as act a social justice warrior for important (identity) causes, but distantly having ethnic ties to a country that has historically been oppressed doesn’t automatically make you oppressed by extension—sometimes your “woke” posts trigger more people than it helps.

I got a Brazilian (a MANzilian as it was appropriately named) about a year ago and I got everything done (pubes, upper thighs, balls, taint, asscrack) and honestly, it didn’t hurt as bad as I was expecting. As someone who has a very low pain tolerance I came in expecting the worst, and admittedly after quite a few screams and my friends bursting out laughing, I found it to be just manageable. I didn’t cry, so I consider it a success by my terms. By far, the pubes/top was the worst along with the upper thighs. I also bled a bit in those areas (as Cindy, my waxoligist commented: “you’re a bleeder!”) The rest wasn’t so bad (relatively speaking) and the asscrack honesty wasn’t that painful (have done again since). I also came in terrified that my buddy might get a little bit “excited” being touched by a woman for a considerable amount of time, but that thing shriveled up inside of me after the first few pulls so much so that I almost commented “I swear it’s bigger than it looks right now” but I held myself back. Overall, I was hairless as a 7 year old for about a month before the hair started growing back in (it was itchy for a few days). Honestly I would do again (after a few shots though).

He orders a steak, no other entree would be able to satisfy him tonight, he tells himself; she orders a salad and wouldn’t be convinced any other way, just like she practiced. At a certain point he stands, but not before checking the collar on his quarter zip, purchased at Macy’s the week before and kept until tonight, “the same day I bought her that perfume,” he thinks to himself. He begins to lower himself on one knee, exhaling from the large meal. Simultaneously, he produces a box from his pocket, “Kay Jewelers” stares back at him from its velveteen lid, golden. This gives him confidence, but he doesn’t know why, in this moment at least. A scene from his childhood flashes to the forefront of his mind. There’s a ball (what kind is it?), the smell of cut grass, and no more. His left knee is halfway to the carpet, steamed just a day ago, as if for tonight. She hasn’t noticed yet, but I have. She must be the only one at this point. He is on one knee now, teetering to one side ever so slightly, yet oh so noticeably. She sees him now, there, beside the table for two. He says her name, but she doesn’t hear or isn't listening. Her hands cover her mouth and nose, just like she imagined that she would. She looks into the gap under the lid, widening, as if aided by her glare. He looks into her eyes. The question comes out of his mouth, not in the way he had practiced it, but without the grammatical errors of his original speech. The image is clearer now; his father walks down the porch steps into the shade cast by the house as the sun begins to set. It’s the day before the first day of school and he’s playing the last game of catch of a summer chock full of games of catch, and trips to the pool, and hide and seek in the basement, and games of catch. He is comfortable and has every reason to believe that every day will be as good as the summer before the fifth grade. \n“Yes.” \nShe hugs him, raising her left heel like she thought she should. An observant few catch a glimpse of the price tag still on the sole of her shoe. I’d bet anything on DSW. Her face is pressed into his chest, lining up uncannily with the embroidered pony. It means so much to him. He focuses on what others are doing. “Should they be applauding?” he wonders, and so do I. Meanwhile, she thinks of the joint Instagram account they (she) will operate when they (she) are (is) pregnant, and how it could launch her “promising” fast fashion influencer career with the choice of an effective, consistent aesthetic. I can tell you, the only consistent thing about those posts is going to be the “shot with Samsung Galaxy” hashtag.\nThe Capital Grille begins to empty. Patrons go their separate ways.

They're essentially banning music on wriston quad, not allowing any events with alcohol on wriston, and are planning to have res life / ESS patrolling dorms looking for people drinking.\n\nOn top of ruining the most fun weekend of the year, the university is also making it far more dangerous. You can bet your ass students are still going to party and drink, so how are they going to do it now? Off campus and/or by binge drinking dangerously. Can't drink? Students are far more likely to do hard drugs.\n\nThe university should be moving in the exact opposite direction of this one. If they let students drink beer/wine openly, there would be far less binge drinking, less hard drug use, and more oversight when things go wrong. These new policies are dangerous and stupid, and we need to figure out a way to rise up and convince the university of that.\n","date":"Feb 13, 2019, 12:15 AM"},{"content":"1874 - my country 'tis of thee,\nAustria-Hungary\nobey your king\n","date":"Feb 11, 2019, 2:37 PM"},{"content":"1873 - orange man good or orange man bad?\n","date":"Feb 11, 2019, 2:37 PM"},{"content":"1872 - Is Thayer 315 the best junior/senior dorm?\n","date":"Feb 11, 2019, 2:37 PM"},{"content":"1871 - What is a good place in Providence for karaoke?\n","date":"Feb 11, 2019, 2:36 PM"},{"content":"1870 - To the group in the Lubrano on 2/11 from 11 to 12:\n\nPlease reserve your room before using it, as sometimes last minute reservations come in for big rooms like the Lubrano and we would hate to have to kick you out.

I feel really unsafe and targeted seeing shows of anti-zionism on campus. It is okay to speak out against injustice, but be aware of your space and privilege. Jewish students deserve to feel welcomed. The BDS movement is not a productive solution and just feels discriminatory to my identity as a Jewish student.\n\nAdditionally, Israel is a democracy. Gay couples can be out and adopt kids. Every religion is tolerated and can vote. Women have been presidents. In the surrounding middle eastern countries, women, gay people, and any people of religions besides islam are extremely discriminated against. How can liberal voices fight the only liberal country in the middle east?\n\nLastly, there is so much anti-semitism in the world...there are neo-nazi groups who would love to see the end of Jews. Israel stands up for Jews and protects them. Without Israel, Jews would be put in an extremely unsafe and volatile position.\n\nSo, just make sure you fully understand the implications of the BDS movement before you stand with it.\n","date":"Feb 11, 2019, 2:35 PM"},{"content":"1867 - Response to #1786: \nI feel you tbh.

I of course understand your frustration. Congratulations on noticing that yes, there is definitely a problem with racial / socioeconomic diversity in sororities here at Brown. I am shocked that Brown students have still not yet realized that boycotting, shitting all over, and “cancelling” institutions that lack diversity and social awareness has never and will never be a proactive attempt at making the changes that we all seek. This is frankly an amateur approach to social justice and simply counterproductive to the goal at hand, which is to have a more diverse and inclusive greek life at Brown. Surprise! Institutions in America from Congress to Hollywood to greek life have historic problems with diversity. Another surprise! These institutions are not changing because you and ten of your friends are hating on them on your social media accounts. The record breaking amounts of women and POC recently elected into congress did not make that historic change by writing to dear blueno about how disheartening the political institutions in our country are. They made that change by noticing a problem, deciding they’d be an active part of the change, and joining those organizations to make changes from within and to set an example for other minorities in America. Believe it or not, these organizations, or at the very least the sororities at brown are trying to do better. You guys know this, because you would be disillusioned to say that you genuinely believe that all 400 something individuals in sororities here are racist and don’t want to be “sisters’ with anyone poor or non-white. It isn’t hard to figure out that it’s not the sororities themselves that are preventing women of color from joining us. But by building up and legitimizing sororoties’ reputations as racist, bigoted, elitist, and undesirable places, you sabotage any chance we have of more diverse individuals becoming interested in and feeling like they have a good chance at joining our organizations in the future. If you were in the room at these rush processes like I was, you would know that the amount of POC girls who actually rushed versus the amount of POC girls who were accepted into sororities is the exact same ratio as the amount of white girls who actually rushed versus the amount of white girls who were accepted into sororities. Unfortunately, as of right now, sororities at Brown don’t actively engage in affirmative action programs, so the only way to increase the amount of melanin in these damn pledge class photos you see all over your newsfeeds is to simply get more women of color to sign up for rush in the coming years. If you want to make these places do better and be better, which you all should whether you’re a part of them or not, you guys need to readjust your social justice action plans here a little bit. While it’s fine and dandy to call these institutions out for their problematic flaws, it’s significantly more productive to represent them for what they really are: places that, like the rest of America, are plagued with racism and inequality, but that are more than well aware of their toxic culture and are trying to do better in the future.

Take care of it & stop making the job of those who already clean up after you more difficult.\n","date":"Feb 2, 2019, 9:57 PM"},{"content":"1680 - if i don't need to take cs33 or cs32 for my track (ai/ml) should i even take them or should i spare myself the pain\n","date":"Feb 2, 2019, 9:22 PM"},{"content":"1679 - Is the microwave in the ratty gone? :(\n","date":"Feb 2, 2019, 9:22 PM"},{"content":"1678 - i really want to start going to the nelson to work out but i'm v socially anxious and kind of out of shape and am (perhaps irrationally???) afraid of being judged.....does anybody have any encouraging words, and/or advice??

You need to use layperson terminology, even if it takes a little longer. CS concepts are stressful enough already. Using unnecessarily complex terminology to teach these concepts just makes things worse, and makes it hard to know whether we’re actually bad at CS or just not being taught properly.

However, protest becomes unacceptable when it obstructs the basic exchange of ideas. Such obstruction is a form of censorship, no matter who initiates it or for what reasons.\n\nProtests or demonstrations that infringe upon the rights of others to peaceful assembly, orderly protest, free exchange of ideas, or that interfere with the rights of others to make use of or enjoy the facilities or attend the functions of the University cannot be tolerated.\n\nPicket lines which permit free passage of those who wish to pass, and signs, banners and peaceful assemblies are all acceptable. However, the carrying of signs that by virtue of their construction constitute a hazard to other people may not be permitted. Specifically, this means that signs should be constructed entirely of soft material such as cardboard or cloth, and that signs should not be attached to rigid sticks or poles when such signs are used inside University buildings. Actions such as the following, are unacceptable: blocking; obstructing or impeding passage of a person or vehicle; actions that result in bodily harm; erecting or placing of obstructions that result in depriving others of their rights.\n\nHalting a lecture, debate, or any public forum is an unacceptable form of protest. \"\"Halting\"\" means directly or indirectly preventing a speaker from speaking - even for a brief period of time - or seizing control of a public forum for one's own purposes.\n\nThe University must be a place where ideas are exchanged freely.

We challenge each other intellectually, we support each other, we love hanging out together, we don’t fight and put lots of effort into communicating/listening, we are both v loyal, etc. It’s really awesome, and I can’t imagine a future without her (and wouldn’t want to). And yet, we have one problem: we don’t have sex anymore. Like the only time we’ve done anything physical in the last 9 or 10 months was once when we decided to schedule sex. I have a relatively high sex drive (that’s right !! Boys/people with penises aren’t the only ones who sometimes wanna fuck things!!), and she really, really does not (although she used to?). She doesn’t even really see it as a problem, insists she’s still attracted to me, that her sex drive will come back, and so on, but it’s been really crushing for my self esteem and my relationship to sex/sexuality. I wouldn’t worry if we just didn’t have lots of sex but still like kisses for more than a few seconds sometimes or at least had some kind of sexual tension, but really it’s like any and all physicality is just gone on her end. I would obviously never pressure her into anything she wouldn’t want to do, but I can’t seem to figure out how to address the fact that I really do think sex/physical attraction is/can be a really healthy and positive and regular part of relationships, and that it does matter to me.\n\nIt’s gotten to the point where I feel really guilty and sad even thinking about sex or feeling horny, let alone masturbating or anything. It feels like I’m letting her down every time I think about sex/sensuality more generally (and in fact it upsets her a bit if I say anything). I have never felt less attractive/more unfuckable in my life (and that’s coming from a girl who has had some *big* self esteem problems historically).\n\nI am not going to break up with her (she is still my everything!!!), monogamy is SUPER important to her (opening things up is off the table), and though we do talk about it and have productive conversations, her interest in a physical relation with me doesn’t seem to be changing at all, despite what she tells me.\n\nThe part that makes it all particularly complicated is that I think a lot of what’s going on is because she is currently trying to process sexual trauma from a past toxic relationship. Her ex was a real piece of shit™️ (lesbians/queer people can be abusive partners too, not just straight bois...). But even before she was with her ex, she said she never really saw sex as important at all, and fully expected (even sometimes looked forward to?) being a relationship long enough to sort of fall out of lust and then just let go of sexuality altogether. \n\nMy question is: how do I best support her as she is sorting out her relationship with sexuality? She says she is not on the ace spectrum or anything and really does think she likes sex (which would be totally fine, and we would just have to communicate about it to make things work), but how do I make sense of her claiming to have an interest in sex/physicality when it genuinely just does not even occur to her that sexuality might be important in a relationship? And how do I work on my own self esteem/relationship with sex (probably independently of her?) so that she doesn’t feel any unnecessary pressure to do anything but I get over feeling so sad/guilty/rejected/completely de-sexualized? Does anyone have experience trying to feel attractive again when their partner/S.O. seems to be losing interest in them sexually (and/or in sexuality more generally)?\n","date":"Jan 26, 2019, 3:14 PM"},{"content":"1434 - whoever is mixing beats in new dorm A, brooooooo fucking stoooop (or wear headphones)\n","date":"Jan 26, 2019, 3:14 PM"},{"content":"1433 - I’m a Econ concentrator in my junior year and want to switch to CS-Econ (A.B.).

I felt similarly during my first year at Brown. I was depressed, isolated, and completely not myself. While everyone else was gaining their freshman 15, I lost more than 15 pounds. I applied to transfer to my state university, but was denied admission - and it's the best thing that has ever happened to me. I just completed a Fifth Year Master's, and would not have traded my remaining years at Brown for anything. Freshman-year-me never would have dreamed of staying four years, let alone wanting to stay an extra year. I'd say obviously do what keeps you safe physically and emotionally, but it does get better, and a huge part of what I learned at Brown was how to manage my mental health and build friendships and a life I enjoyed in a new place. I will say it didn't change overnight. But I found that once I made a couple close friends, laid down even a few happy memories, and fell in love with Rhode Island a little, I found I wanted to stay at Brown. You'll come away with life experience few have, and wherever you grew up will always be waiting for you. p.s. A few things that worked for me: taking classes that actually interested me, even if they were way too easy or way too hard (S/NC); finding nice, good-natured people and making friends with them; being physically activate in some way; and not staying in my room! – this was really hard because of my anxiety, but everything felt a little lighter when I started being/eating/studying outside my room; and lastly I came out as gay (realize that may not be applicable/beneficial, but I did find that \"\"discovering and being my authentic self\"\" *shudders* improved my anxiety/depression)\n","date":"Jan 26, 2019, 2:57 PM"},{"content":"1409 - If you’re posting on the Buying and Selling page, please put clothing size somewhere in the description!!

I think we can all agree with the fact that the way the house has managed “official communications” and how some of their members have reacted to all the allegations posted on this page has been extremely unprofessional. There are better channels to use to publish official statements like their own Facebook page or the BDH. \n\nAt the same time, the most recent declarations from current members and former members are also very controversial, especially those coming from students looking to collect signatures. First off, Buxton members are not getting evicted, they are being relocated, most of us have been relocated through our time at Brown, and yes, it is a pain in the ass but please refrain from manipulating public opinion with fake statements. On the other hand, as a member of the international community myself, I can also say that a big part of the international community has never liked Buxton or felt comfortable with Buxton members or their activities. None of the events they organize have been meant to represent the international community or help international students. At the same time, the events that have taken place recently were long time coming. I cannot even recall a moment throughout my time at Brown when Buxton was not on probation. \n\nThe allegations against the house range from hazing, consumption of drugs, especially cocaine (if you actually scroll through some of their party pictures, it will not be difficult to find cocaine lines on some tables), damaging parts of the house repeatedly (probably while being on drugs), and sexual harassment and sexual assault. I personally know myself more than 2 members who have had Title IX charges pushed against them. Residential Life gave Buxton countless opportunities to reform their community and change their behavior, but it seems that the different boards that have led the house have either not done what they should have, or they maybe did not care enough to take action against certain members. In cases like these, I wonder if the current or former boards should also be liable for the allegations against certain house members.\n\nAt the same time, there is another point I want to make clear, Buxton is not a “safe space for international students”, please stop using that rhetoric. In the first place, if we look at Buxton demographics, you’ll find out that a big percentage of members are not even international student themselves, they are mostly half American, half [insert random nationality here] or kids who attended the International/Bilingual/American/British school of wherever, and many of them hold American citizenship or a green card. In fact, many of them do not know much about their “native” culture or origins. This is why many international student community members do not feel that this house represents us or that it should not represent the international community in any way. Similarly, please stop spreading fake rumors that Americans do not get admitted in the house because, as I stated before, a big percentage of Buxton kids hold American citizenship. In light of this, I would also like to address a student who responded aggressively and dismissively to post 1202. Given that non-domestic students cannot access need-blind financial aid, your aggressive attack on a post from someone who was just expressing their discomfort with the Buxton community was full of inaccuracies and lies and it just perpetuates the \nunprofessional approach that has been portrayed by current or former members of Buxton.\n\nIf Buxton is going to look for support from other students, please be transparent and professional about what is going on, refrain from posting manipulative information and just be honest about your intentions. Given that the Dean of the College was a former member of Buxton and he has not come out to the house’s defense, it also says something about the lack of confidence on the organization from the school.\n","date":"Jan 19, 2019, 10:12 PM"},{"content":"1282 - The same guys who keep texting you after you repeatedly ghost them are the same guys who keep defending CS.

With that in mind, though, I also feel like there are a lot of mental health related things that don’t really get brought up enough and aren’t really talked about, so I wanted to briefly talk about them here.\n\n1: Destigmatize\n\nAs said already, I think Brown students are good about destigmatizing mental health, but it’s kind of one of those things you can’t really say enough. If you’re reading this and you’ve felt weird about going to CAPS, getting help of some form, seeking out a diagnosis, or taking medication, you shouldn’t! Mental health is a thing, and you’re pretty super cool, so you should be happy and feel healthy, and you should do what you need to do to be happy and healthy! I’m rooting for you!\n\n2: Mental Health issues are valid even if you don’t have a Mental Illness\n\nI think at Brown, people have a nasty habit of not wanting to identify with something unless they can REALLY identify with it. You see this in a lot of different settings here, but in the context of mental health, I think a lot of people feel like they can’t or shouldn’t talk about their mental health unless they’re REALLY depressed or have serious mental health problems, because they feel either like they’re taking up space from people with more serious problems, or that people with more serious problems will judge them and won’t accept them because their problems aren’t as bad.\n\nSo I wanted to say this: You can be mentally unhealthy even if your depression or anxiety or other mental illnesses seem really minor, and that’s valid. More so, though, you can be mentally unhealthy without any sort of mental illness, _*and that’s totally valid too*_.\n\nI really want to stress that if you’re unhappy or chronically stressed or just mentally unhealthy in general, even if you don’t have a mental illness, _*you can still seek out help, go to CAPS, or get a therapist*_. _***Your issues aren’t magically less real or valid just because you don’t have a diagnosis.***_\n\nThe fact is, Brown is tough. Finding friends here is tough, the classes kick your ass sometimes, if you’re dealing with money issues, that’s a nightmare, and there’s a million reasons why you might be unhappy, stressed, anxious, totally fried, and mentally unhealthy. A lot of people seem to say “Yeah, I don’t have anxiety or depression -- I’m just stressed because of my classes and a little unhappy because things aren’t going great for me.”\n\nWell guess what! You’re stressed because of your classes and you’re unhappy because things aren’t going that great for you! That sounds like a really good reason to sit down and talk with someone or take steps to ensure that you can manage your stress, feel happier, and you don’t have to endure four long years of mental fatigue and pain!\n\nWe tend to view therapy, CAPS, and mental health services as things that we’re only allowed to use if we’re depressed or have some sort of mental illness._*This isn’t true.*_ You’re super cool, and you deserve to be happy and healthy, so do what you need to do to be happy and healthy! If that’s hitting up a therapist “even though” you don’t have depression, oh my lordy, you should do it! I’m rooting for you!\n\n3: Chronic Sadness is different from Depression, but both are equally valid\n\nDepression isn’t the same as chronic sadness. If someone has depression, they could eat a perfectly well balanced diet for a month, be on a great sleep schedule, have friends who love them deeply, be given their dream job, and then be taken out on an all-expense paid vacation, and they’d still wake up with depression. While depression is tied to mental stressors and there’s a lot of factors involved, depression isn’t so much a statement on how good or bad someone’s life is, it’s a statement about chemicals in the brain not behaving exactly how they need to.\n\nDue to a lot of points raised in the last section, though, a lot of people have the mindset that their issues aren’t real, they’re not allowed to seek out therapy, and they’re not allowed to take actionable steps towards improving their mental health _*unless*_ they get a diagnosis of something. People think that unless there’s a name for what their issue is, it’s not as valid.\n\nSo I just want to throw this out there and be really emphatic about it: \nIF YOU DON’T HAVE DEPRESSION, YOU DON’T WANT TO GET DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSION.\nDEPRESSION MEDICATIONS WILL NOT HELP YOU IF YOU DON’T HAVE DEPRESSION.\n\nI say this because the truth of the matter is, _*sometimes Brown sucks ass*_. Some people hate their entire four years here. Between how hard classes can be, how hard it is to find friends that make you happy or not finding any friends at all, imposter syndrome, not loving what you do, being rejected from clubs and internships, not having any meaningful personal projects or hobbies so you feel worthless and don’t know how to spend your free time, struggling to get by with money, the occasionally stifling social atmosphere here, and about a million other things, _for some people, Brown just legit sucks ass for the entire four years that you’re here._\n\nCombine that with the fact that most of us who aren’t happy here tend to self-medicate with large amounts of alcohol, not treat our bodies well, are often dehydrated, eat like shit or not enough, and have really fucked up sleep schedules, you may wake up one day and realize that you’re low on energy, have brain fog, can’t muster up the motivation to do your work, often feel sad, hopeless, or empty, and are perpetually stressed or anxious. You will wake up with all of the symptoms of depression.\n\nAnd at that point, you might diagnose yourself with depression, or you might talk to a friend, and they might tell you you’re depressed. But if you think that if we took you away from Brown, had you doing something you actually loved, your money issues disappeared, and you had friend who really loved you, then you’d suddenly get happy and feel normal, your problems are still super 100% valid, and you probably should hit up CAPS, talk to someone, and take steps to make yourself happy, because you’re super cool and you deserve it. But, it’s also really important to understand that that’s different than being depressed.\n\nThe reasons I wanted to start this conversation are that 1: as mentioned earlier, people feel like their problems aren’t valid unless they get a diagnosis, and 2: if you try to get a diagnosis and you have the symptoms mentioned above, you can. Most doctors will give it to you, and in general, most doctors don’t really differentiate between depression caused by chemical imbalances and regular chronic sadness that’s there for understandable reasons. And if you try to get your hands on depression medication from there, you also probably can.\n\nThe point here isn’t that medication is bad, or that you’re not depressed -- medication is an amazing treatment for depression, and depression is totally real, you very well might have it, and if you’ve been dealing with it for a while, you know you have it. But I think we need to start having serious talks about destigmatizing mental health issues that aren’t mental illnesses, we need to start recognizing that we can’t treat them identically, and we need to stop telling people they’re depressed or pushing them into believing they’re depressed if they’re not.\n\nI think some of that might end up being seen as controversial. It kind of strays from advice which tells us to always trust ourselves if we think we might have a mental illness, or that if we do, doctors will know and they’ll always get this kind of stuff right. If you have different thoughts about any of this, please throw them in the comments or a follow up post! This is meant to start a conversation about something I think is important and explain what I think about it, not be a post where I claim to be the be-all end-all expert on what’s right for you.\n\nPast that, I just want to reiterate the normal stuff. You’re valid no matter what you’re feeling. If you’re feeling mentally healthy, or even if you’re not, but you have the energy, remember to check in on your friends (or even people you’re not too close with) and give people the support that they need. Most of all, though, regardless of why you’re not feeling so hot, what the causes are, how serious it is, or any of that, I’m rooting for you! I hope you feel better and that if past years haven’t been able to give that to you, that 2019 is finally the year where things start to look up! That’s all.\n","date":"Jan 19, 2019, 10:03 PM"},{"content":"1240 - \ncw: israel/palestine discourse\n\nThis page is so toxic.

Arabs are a majority within the areas Israel governs/occupies, yet Jews make up 80% of the electorate. And do you know why Palestinians live in refugee camps? Most Jews also immigrated recently: Jews only became a majority east of the Green Line after what Benny Morris called the \"\"ethnic cleansing\"\" of 1948 (Morris is no Leftist — he justified the Naqba by saying that \"\"even American democracy could not have been created without the annihilation of the Indians\"\"). If you'd seen videos of Israeli cops eagerly beating Ethiopians, you'd know their \"\"anti-racism\"\" laws don't mean anything. \n\nIt's easy to make discriminatory laws look legitimate. Look at Rhodesia and Alabama, which required property or \"\"literacy tests\"\" to vote with the intention of disenfranchising black voters. Israel insists on controlling everything between the river and the sea, but it would never give Palestinians voting rights because they constitute what Prime Minister Shimon Peres called a \"\"demographic threat\"\" (Israeli peace offers in 2000 and 2008 would have made Palestine look more like a Bantustan than an independent state).\n\nDo you think Israel would ever accept an Arab PM? Even after the Knesset recently flirted with the legalizing housing discrimination? And why does someone born in Nablus not have a \"\"Right of Return,\"\" but someone born in Buenos Aires does?\n\nIsrael is a colonial settler-state. The government literally encourages \"\"settlers\"\". It's not a coincidence that Israel was the only country besides South Africa to support the racist Rhodesian regime. Israel even sold nuclear weapons to Apartheid South Africa, and it was one of four countries to oppose the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Herzl proudly called Zionism a colonial project, and he even asked for the help of Cecil Rhodes to fund it.\n\nIsrael is fun and all, and that's probably why you're so offended by the South Africa comparison. Apartheid South Africa == bad, but Israelis are cool and hip and support queer people (unless it's a pride parade in Jerusalem). There's no more Apartheid government, so you can talk about it in historical terms, but Israelis are real, and you know they're not evil. Because of your ethnicity, you'll never have to see Israel from the other perspective.\n\nA Jewish nation-state is a valid goal. So would a Roma or Rohingya state. But telling people of color to get out of the way is not a solution for discrimination by Europeans. It's valid for people to treat Israel the same way as South Africa. It might be the only way obtain justice for Palestinians. Your version of \"\"calling for better treatment of Palestinians\"\" certainly won't.\n","date":"Jan 19, 2019, 10:00 PM"},{"content":"1227 - cw: mention of rape\n\nsuper fun to see all the rape apologists on this page and esp fun to see my rapist's apologists (and those who didnt believe my rapist had apologists) condemn them! we love lack of self awareness and performative allyship!\n","date":"Jan 19, 2019, 10:00 PM"},{"content":"1226 - Hey everyone!

There are plenty of reasons to criticize the Israeli government. However, Israel is not an apartheid state, and it is really sad when people argue that it is. The Israel-Palestine conflict is really complex and I can’t address most of it in this post, but let me explain some things about Israel.\n\nEveryone living in Israel is equal under the law. Doesn’t matter whether you’re Jewish, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Arab, African, European, Asian, male, female, non-binary, transgender, gay, bisexual, etc. Meanwhile, virtually every other country in the Middle East actively persecutes people who are Jewish/Christian/LGBTQ+. Arabs hold many political positions within the Israeli government and court system. Israel has stricter anti-racism laws than the US.\n\nSo to single out Israel—the most liberal, modern, democratic, and progressive country in the Middle East—as an “apartheid state” really doesn’t make sense to me. Israeli Arabs/Muslims have more freedom than Arabs/Muslims in Arab/Muslim countries. Think about that for a second. I’m not denying that Israel does bad things, but to compare it to apartheid South Africa is just idiotic. Focus on improving the condition of impoverished Palestine refugees who live under the control of terrorist organizations. People who live in Israel enjoy a liberal democracy; they’re not living in an apartheid state.\n","date":"Jan 17, 2019, 10:27 PM"},{"content":"1219 - Thank you for turning me down! and F.U. for treating me like crap afterwards 🖕but thanks again, because it only made me stronger!!!

A CS course shouldn’t make me have to choose between TA hours or a language conversation table, or even between TA hours and going to an “easy” class- both of which happened to me on several occasions, and every time I felt that hours were more important.

As a Jew, I felt sort of odd about it. I wanted to throw some nuance into the conversation, because, to be honest, as a Jew, I feel like we kind of need it.\n\nAntisemitism is a thing. You really can't argue otherwise. In the past couple years, we've seen a large number of literal nazis in the U.S. flat out say they hate Jewish people and they identify with the beliefs that led to and fueled the literal holocaust. They've held rallies. There's a lot of them. In the face of that, if you want to say that antisemitism doesn't exist, you really are just wrong.\n\nAt the same time, I think we have to be cognizant of the fact that we all currently exist in a really politically left environment. It's 100% true that the Jewish people face societal oppression, and it's also 100% true that Christian people don't. While totally true, and while I don't speak for anyone but myself when I say this, my personal experience at Brown as a Jew is that if you tell someone you're Jewish, or even if you tell someone you're an observant, practicing Jew, they'll respect your beliefs and your right to your faith. In fact, my experience has been that people get much worse reactions from telling people they're devout Christians -- you can see mental alarms going off in some people's head and they treat it like a red flag.\n\nAll of this is not to say that Jews aren't oppressed or that we should actually be concerned about Christian oppression or some such nonsense like that. What it is to say is that because we exist in such a politically left environment where antisemitism isn't the norm, and is, at least in some spaces here, more respected than the main religious beliefs of those atop the societal power structure, I'm not really shocked or horrified that there are people who go to Brown who aren't aware that antisemitism is a real issue, and hearing them say that in some cold-take Dear Blueno post truthfully doesn't really make me feel oppressed.\n\nI also flat out don't feel remotely as oppressed as pretty much any other minority group. I don't face a fraction of the oppression that black people do -- that muslims do -- that trans people do. In fact, while there are stereotypes about how Jews look like and what our physical features are, you can't even tell someone's Jewish from looking at them, which means that any sort of prejudice people have against us isn't going to affect us in our day to day lives in the way it affects, say, people of color.\n\nAnd I know social justice isn't an \"\"either or\"\" situation where we have to pick only one group to treat with basic respect, but save for serious things like the recent shooting, where everyone, goyim included, should be checking on their Jewish friends and standing in solidarity with the Jewish community, I dunno, I legitimately don't think I deserve people's emotional labor for this stuff. In this case, the filtered posts in the mod post aren't even from people who hate Jews or said anything bad about us, they're just ignorant people who don't realize that OTHER people hate us. Like I said, it's kind of disappointing, but honestly, it's not really shocking and at the end of the day doesn't really make me feel oppressed.\n\nMaybe this is an ugly cold take, even if I'm a Jew. I don't know. As said above, there's no denying that antisemitism is real. There just isn't. Additionally, everything I said here was my personal experiences. It'd be wrong to project my experiences onto everyone else or make a blanket statement for the Jewish community. More so, everyone reacts to things differently and your own personal feelings are totally valid, nor do I wish to discredit that or discredit anyone else's experiences. I just kind of feel like at least some of this needs to be thrown out there and talked about for an issue like this.\n","date":"Jan 17, 2019, 4:56 PM"},{"content":"1194 - Can anyone post official documents from the Buxton hearing?\n","date":"Jan 17, 2019, 4:56 PM"},{"content":"1193 - If you think south asians arent/shouldnt be considered asian youre a piece of shit 😘\n","date":"Jan 17, 2019, 4:56 PM"},{"content":"1192 - I'm a junior and have never been in a relationship.

I don’t think that’s a mission I’ve really completed, per se, but nonetheless, I’ve made some pretty good headway on it over the years. Below I’ve broken up everywhere I’ve eaten in Providence into categories, given them brief reviews, and ranked them in some sort of rough-ish order based on how happy they make me and how likely I am to go again. If you’re looking for a new place to grab a bite, hopefully this helps a bit! Alternatively, if you’d like to propose a different order in which to rank these restaurants, please do so in the comments so that I know how totally wrong your taste buds are, and I can judge you! Thanks!\n\nYou’ll note that there are some restaurants missing from the list, even along Thayer street. This is because, despite having been here for a few years, there are still some places I never got a chance to hit up. If you know of any restaurants not on this list that you really enjoyed eating at, I’d love it if you put them in the comments, as I’m still trying to find good new places to eat! At some point, I’d also love to do this again, but for the bars in Providence, so assuming I’m able to scrounge up enough friends who have too much free time and drink too much, stay tuned! And by all means, throw bar recommendations in the comments too so I start on the right foot.\n\nI also apologize for the weird formatting. It’d be cleaner if I could insert horizontal lines and use bold or italicized text to make it more obvious where a new restaurant started, but alas, we work with what we’re given, so there’s just a lot of CAPITALIZATION running rampant throughout the post.\n\nSo without further ado, \n\nA Short Review and Ranking of Everywhere I’ve Eaten in Providence:\n\n**BREAKFAST**:\n\nDUCK AND BUNNY:\nLordy, this place is just really good. It’s so fun! They have famous paintings, but where the people are ducks and bunnies! They have really super cool cupcakes! They have great alcohol and coffee drinks! On top of that the vibe is just really relaxed and cute and the food is guaranteed to make you happy. It’s sadly a little on the pricey side compared to most places to grab a meal, but if you’re on the “brunch” level with someone you’re seeing, this is pretty unambiguously where you should be going for a date.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nFor brunch, the Eggs Bun-a-Duck with the potato latkes as the base and for the toppings, either the salmon or the bacon, tomato, and pesto. The Mazzy Star also really kills it with the truffle oil, and if you’re looking for something savory, the T.S. Geller really nails it with the horseradish cream. Drink wise, it’s hard to go wrong. Their tea menu is ridiculous, and last I was there, I think I got a lavender bergamot tea. They also will turn any tea into a tea latte, have pretty good honey lattes, and fun breakfast alcohol drinks too.\n\nBRICKWAY ON WICKENDEN:\nIf I want to go grab some breakfast, I pretty much will always hit up Louis, Duck and Bunny, or Brickway on Wickenden. It’s just a really solid place to grab a bite, and I just kinda get a kick out of the homey feel and rotating muffin specials.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nI generally go for the Eden omelette with goat cheese. It simultaneously fulfills my desires to be well fed, feel healthy, and also feel weirdly snooty because I’m eating goat cheese. Heads up though, their only hot sauce is Frank’s, which is always solid, but I dunno, they could really just benefit from having some red and green tabasco around, you feel?\n\nLOUIS:\nYou know it. You love it. You’ve probably stayed up all night and gone there at 5:00 AM at some point in your college career, and if you haven’t, you probably will. It’s also a pretty solid spot to grab a cheap bite, see people you know, or nourish your body after pulling an all-nighter and forgetting that there isn’t anywhere that sells food on campus between the hours of 2 to 5 AM.\n\nPersonal Favorites: \nWhile not the healthiest option on the menu, the Drunk Johnny omelette is a hedonistic pleasure full of corned beef hash, cheese, and onions. It’s done me really well on most of the times I’ve been drunk or hungover at 5:00 AM in the morning. If you’re hoping to go in a different route, and you’re looking for something filling but simple and cost effective, you can also go for a small cup of grits, two eggs, and some toast for a bit over $5. The Hot Chocolates here are also really solid and I like their mugs.\n\nThings I Didn’t Love So Much:\nTheir hot sauce really just tastes like regular ass marinara sauce. I really don’t know what that’s about but I can’t explain to you how much it upset me, and I’m still trying to forgive them for that one even though it’s been over a year.\n\nOLGA’S CUP AND SAUCER:\nI liked this place! It’s truthfully too far of a trek from me to make it worth going to on any regular sort of basis, but I went once for breakfast and had the horchata latte (which was snooty and large and tasty and aesthetic) and a really good avocado toast. I felt hella basic, and truthfully, it was worth it! I think I even liked it a bit more than Brickway’s vibe, and if I recall, it had outdoor seating too. I’d recommend going at least once, and I’d definitely go back if it were closer and the prices were a bit lower than they are.\n\nROGUE ISLAND:\nCute! Bougie! I only went once for brunch, and I ended up getting some weird daily hash that they had. Really positive experience despite the fact that it’s a little bit of a trek. Probably will be back eventually.\n\nMEETING STREET CAFE:\nReally pretty much like the other diner like options, but due to its location, pricier. I also just don’t like the atmosphere as much as brickway, duck and bunny, olgas, or louis. Went once and never really went back.\n\n**CHEAP/TAKE-OUT FOOD**:\n\nBAJA’S:\nThere really is nothing else on this list that has captured such a large part of my heart and soul. The truth is, Baja’s make me kind of emotional and I’m kind of tearing up a little right now as I write this. Who else has my back at 2:00 AM in the morning? Because Baja’s does. Baja’s really DID that, and at the end of the day, that’s that on that.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nNachos, generally with the steak or ground beef, but occasionally with the pork. Throw some pinto beans and rice on that bad boy and load it all the way up with pico and guac, and you’re ready to be extra happy and wake up with a wild case of heartburn in the morning.\n\nEAST SIDE POCKETS:\nTruly a blessing to the Brown community. Their food has always struck me as pretty nutritionally complete, it’s wildly delicious, it’s cheap compared to pretty much everything else on Thayer, and it’s open til 2 making its only late night contenders Baja’s and Insomnia. There’s really nothing bad to say about it.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nGyro, Kafta, or Falafel wrap. The sweet “hot” sauce is a favorite, and in general, all the toppings is the way to go.\n\nBAGEL GOURMET:\nIf you live in Barbour, Grad Center, or New Dorm, Bagel Gourmet is truly a godsend. Super cheap if you order right, and in general, just a happy place. I will not tolerate any bad words thrown its way, because it just makes me happy. Despite my love for BGO, I’ve never been to the Ole version, and I dunno, I kind of just don’t want to.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nEverything bagels are pretty much always where it’s at. Best with some peanut butter (bagel with peanut butter is $2!) or with lox, cream cheese, onion, tomato, and lettuce.\n\nLA CREPERIE:\nHonestly pretty slept on in terms of tastiness and bang for buck. A good selection of sweet and savory crepes along with some really solid (if slightly overpriced) smoothies.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nThe Rosina or the Mary. My current standard order is the breakfast crepe, which is just scrambled eggs inside, and you can add on cheese or a vegetable too. I generally go for the roasted red peppers or the spinach. It’s wicked cheap compared to pretty much everything on thayer. They also have some strawberry soy-milk splash smoothie, if I recall, and you’ll hate yourself while you’re drinking it because you’re drinking a strawberry soy-milk splash smoothie, but it’s also undeniably the bomb dot com, so take that as you will.\n\nPOKEWORKS:\nWould really be amazing, but they were overpriced even before they raised their prices, and now I just can’t justify going there.\n\nPersonal Favorite:\nPoke Bowl, either with sushi rice or kale noodles, two scoops of salmon, kale, shiso, cucumber, mango, edamame, hijiki and ogo seaweed, heavy wasabi aioli, masago, ginger, wasabi, furikake, seaweed salad, lotus chips, garlic crisps, shredded nori, and onion crisps with a bit of soy sauce to dip in. If you ever need to buy me a poke bowl, now you know!\n\nHARUKI EXPRESS:\nI continue to be flabbergasted by how much sushi costs in Providence. 16 pieces of sashimi costs $17!!! You’re charging us over a dollar for a very itty bitty bite of fish!!! Literally AHH, what’s with this??\n\nThat being said, haruki occasionally hits the spot. While the sushi is overpriced, make sure to grab a cup of miso soup, which is nice, warming, and under 2 bucks.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nI’m a sucker for salmon rolls and salmon skin rolls. If you feel differently, I respect your opinion, but your opinion is also incorrect, and that’s totally okay! I also occasionally really dig some eel.\n\nCHIPOTLE:\nIncluded for the sake of completeness. It’s good and I enjoy it, but it’s also a chipotle and you don’t need my review on a chipotle.\n\nPersonal favorite:\n“Salad” (burrito bowl that also includes lettuce) with sofritas or barbacoa.\n\nBAJA’S #2:\nI’m still kind of confused about this one, and honestly, just altogether a bit upset. The original Baja’s has my heart, and even if this new imposter tries really hard and puts in the work, I will never call Baja’s #2 “Dad,” you feel?\n\n**STANDARD RESTAURANTS**:\n\nGANKO ITTETSU RAMEN:\nQuickly becoming one of my favorite meals on campus. They’re a bit limited in what they offer right now -- they don’t have any hot drinks, and they’re just getting started on appetizers, so if you go there, you’re pretty much just going to get a bowl of ramen -- but their ramen really is great. Paired with a pretty fun little beer and cider menu, it’s a great place to go to treat yourself. If they ever put coffee and a few good green teas like sencha and genmaicha on the menu, it’s over for all the other restaurants. If you can get past how cringey you feel when the predominantly white staff shouts “ARIGATOU GOZAIMASU” every couple seconds when someone leaves, and the fact that the ramen is a bit on the pricey side, it’s just about as good as restaurants around here get.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nEither of the pear ciders, and the Tan Tan. The black garlic oil and the spicy garlic oil also deserve their own shoutout.\n\nORIGINAL DEN DEN:\nIt’s a bit out of the way, but that’s probably for the best for everyone’s wallets, because if it were any closer, many of us would eat there waaay too often. There’s really almost nothing to not love. The food rocks. The atmosphere is cute. It serves a variety of different coffee drinks, and even a really tasty matcha green tea latte. If you’re looking for some place that will never let you down, this is it.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nThe Bibimbap is killer, and if you’re looking for a really tasty entree that doesn’t break the bank, the Udon soup is always really solid and great on a cold day. I’ve yet to try it, but I’ve also heard great things about the Short Rib BBQ. The appetizers are also killer -- if I need to feel remotely healthy, I’ll go for the Spicy Tuna Salad (which is tuna with a spicy sauce, not Spicy Tuna like you might find in a sushi roll) as an entree even though it’s listed as an appetizer. The gyoza, sunomono, and fried noodle rolls are also really solid, with a special shoutout to the Ohitashi and the Seafood Scallion Pancakes, both of which I enjoy a lot and find to be pretty different. As said though, it’s a bit hard to go wrong here\n\nDEN DEN KFC:\nA newer addition to the college hill eating scene and largely unlike its sibling store on RISD’s campus. In full honesty, I find the menu pretty hit or miss. Some of their soups, like the Korean Beef Soup and the Dumpling Soup can be a little bland, and the broth kind of just tastes like saltwater. On the flip side, if you know what to order, it can be one of the best meals you’ll have on campus. Naturally, the Korean fried chicken is pretty good. Both the Soy Garlic and the Spicy flavors are tasty, although I generally find after a few pieces of the soy garlic, it’s a bit too sweet, whereas the spicy has a really nice tang to it even though it’s really not spicy at all. Great place to take friends and share some of the appetizers with.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nVanilla Latte with Beef Bulgogi or Spicy Pork Korean BBQ. The curry katsu was also pretty good, but after enough times ordering things I didn’t love, I stopped exploring the menu, so there’s still a lot I haven’t eaten.\n\nThings I didn’t love:\nDumpling soup, Korean Beef Soup, Cheesy Boneless Chicken (it’s just their regular korean fried chicken with melted cheese, which honestly isn’t too bad but got kind of boring after a while and didn’t feel like a meal as much as a large appetizer)\n\nHENG THAI:\nReally just a great atmosphere overall. On top of having a good selection of great food, the drink menu is top notch, making it a great place for a friends’ night out or a date. For a lot of the things you order, the proportion is pretty huge, so come prepared, and expect that you might be taking home some leftovers. Pro tip: If you get a dish that you expected chopsticks for, but only get a spoon and a fork, it’s not because they think you can’t handle chopsticks. Those dishes are traditionally eaten by pushing food onto the spoon with your fork and eating from the spoon.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nPot of tea or thai iced tea for a drink, scallion pancakes with peanut sauce for appetizer (sorry, I’m a bit basic, but it’s a hedonistic pleasure), and then for entrees the Ba Mee is a bit sweet, but I really enjoy it. I was also a huge fan of the hot basil fried rice, and it was a ton of food. The green curry, pad c u, and the pad thai are also very solid, but pretty much exactly what you’d expect and nothing more.\n\nSAWADEE THAI RESTAURANT:\nI’ve never really heard anyone talk about this place. I feel like it’s pretty slept on considering it’s actually really close to the Barbour/Perkins area. It’s small, cute, and cosy inside, and the menu is kind of a clusterfuck with dozens of little “special’s” menus tucked under the glass of the tables, but I dunno, I just like it. I’ve had things there that really weren’t very good, but if you know what to order, it’s honestly a pretty great meal.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nThey have three “whole fish” dishes on the menu, and I’ve had the Garlic Fish and the Honey Fish, both of which were reaaaally good. I also recall really enjoying the beef in Rama Sauce. For appetizers, the curry puffs always do it for me.\n\nThings I Didn’t Love So Much:\nI tried the thai noodle soup, which was just altogether disappointing. The meat I chose was the duck, because well-prepared duck makes me very happy, but not gonna lie, it was just really bad, and I have a suspicion that all of their duck dishes aren’t going to be that good.\n\nTALLULAH’S TAQUERIA:\nCute! Quirky! Reasonably good spot for a fun meal with a date that doesn’t break the bank. Depending on where you live, it might be quite the trek to make it there, but if it’s in your neck of the woods, you probably know it well and love it dearly. I went there once and made the mistake of getting fish nachos, which, in retrospect doesn’t sound that great, but I went with it anyway. I’d suggest not getting that, but otherwise, it’s just a yummy dig, and they have some outdoor seating too!\n\nKABOB & CURRY:\nA classic staple of college hill dining with a friendly and warm atmosphere inside. It’s likely that the majority of Kabob & Curry that you’ve eaten has been either from the Blue Room or from catered events, but the dine-in experience is worth it in its own right. Always filling and always tasty, pretty much regardless of what you get. I honestly feel pretty bad putting it this low, because it really is a staple and makes me happy, but I think I overdid this one my first two years, and now it’s time for the other restaurants to shine.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nSaag Paneer, garlic naan, potato masala dosa, rose cardamom lassi, salmon tikka\n\nHARRY’S:\nSince the death of BBC (rest in peace, but also, good riddance), harry’s really is the go-to place if you’re looking for a good burger. And it really delivers. They have fun shakes. They have fun beers. What’s not to love? And the atmosphere is really exactly what you’d want and expect while grabbing a shake and a burger. Be forewarned, however, if you’re planning on eating a nice big burger, they only serve them as mini-sliders in sets of 2 or 3.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nThe Crunch Burger or the M.O.A.B (mother of all burgers) are pretty much the go-to’s for me. As one would expect, you always need to grab a side of fries too, as not doing so is sacrilegious to the burger gods.\n\nFLATBREAD CO:\nTasty, hipster pizza in a fun atmosphere. Is there really anything else to say?\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nJay’s Heart, Providence Community Flatbread, Mopsy’s Kalua Pork Pie\n\nBEE’S THAI CUISINE:\nOne of the best known and most fun BYOB restaurants, and it’s also right across the street for a liquor store. Standard thai faire, and in general, solid all around. If I wanted something like a thai beef salad or some pad thai, this is probably the first place I’d think to go.\n\nWOW BARBECUE:\nPretty different than anything I’ve had before, even when it comes to authentic Chinese. Once in a while you stumble upon something not worth getting, like the Fried Bun, but in general, the food is kind of fun. Admittedly, if you decide to go with getting a bunch of their skewers, they’re a bit overpriced and not much food, but the experience will be fun. For instance, I ordered a big thing of cartilage, which is something I’ve never seen on a menu elsewhere. It was pretty good, although if you’re someone who cares about consistency of the things you eat, it feels like you’re eating… cartilage. It’s also one of the only places around here you can get some nice hot sake.\n\nPersonal Favorite:\nWOW isn’t a staple for me, but occasionally I’ll hit it up for the general tso’s tofu. It’s nothing to write home about, and truthfully if you’re hitting up an authentic Chinese Barbecue place, it’s probably worth getting something else, but it’s filling, it’s tasty, and if I recall, it’s only 6 bucks, making it one of the best bang for your buck sit-down meals I’ve found on campus.\n\nSOBAN:\nSolid korean food on Thayer. I really haven’t been here in ages, but I recall not being disappointed and enjoying my meals. I don’t think I’d write home about the place, save for the fact that they had unlimited sides and miso soup, which was one of the best unexpected meal freebies I’ve ever happened upon.\n\nYAN’S CUISINE:\nAnother classic for the denizens of the dorms around Jo’s. I never ended up going there for hotpot, which I believe is a more recent addition, but that’s a thing, and I imagine that’s a thing that is good! Otherwise, it’s kind of what you’d expect, and I never found myself disappointed, so props to them.\n\nANDREAS:\nSolid food, solid date spot. If you’re craving some greek food, always a good spot to grab some spanakopita and dolmathakia. Personally, never really wowed me, but I will say that their menu really runs the gamut when it comes to price, so you can make a night out of it by getting some lobster ravioli, or you can have a casual meal with a lamb burger or some souvlaki.\n\nB.GOOD:\nSnooty, but I like it! They do a decent job of making very healthy things taste pretty good! And while the vibe indoors still feels a bit reminiscent of the Johnny Rockets that preceded it, and I pretty much never go there, in my heart, I still give it a thumb’s up.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nThe Power Bowl\n\nWONG’S:\nIn general, your classic take-out variety chinese food, but the dine-in version. Nothing much to say about it, as I’ve only ever ordered the pho, which consistently hits the spot and is very filling even if the broth isn’t the traditional pho broth you might expect at a no-nonsense vietnamese place.\n\nBY CHLOE:\nI went once just to see what the fuss was about. Honestly, the food was pretty decent, if a bit on the small portion side. At first I thought it was wildly overpriced, but if I recall, they offered a pretty big student discount. I believe I got their faux mac and cheese and enjoyed. The interior isn’t completely my thing, but the fun little seats by the window are, admittedly, fun little seats. I’m sure it’s an amazing spot for people watching.\n\n**SPECIAL SHOUTOUT**:\nI’m putting this in it’s own section because price wise, it’s kind of quasi between a regular restaurant and a fancy restaurant depending on how much you get, and I don’t really know where to place it. I also wanted to give it it’s on section because it’s maybe my favorite on here in terms of a fun dining experience that doesn’t totally break the bank. I’ve only been once, but if I had to suggest one place worth checking out or going back to, I’d probably say it’s this one.\n\nNORTH:\nObnoxiously hard to google due to its name (find them at foodbynorth. com), but one of the most fun restaurant experiences I’ve ever had. Really great food, and suuuuch a great atmosphere. It’s also one of those places where you can sit at a little bar and watch the food be made right in front of you. A lot of the dishes are reasonably small and good for sharing, and I recall the drink menu being really weird in a way I didn’t know how to feel about (I’m pretty sure I saw red wine mixed with coca-cola on the there?) At the end of the day though, this place is really hella quirky, and is probably my first choice if I want a fun spot for a dinner date.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nIt looks like they change their menu up a lot, but when I was there I had the Dan Dan Noodles, which kicked ass and had this really well done crispy broccoli in them. I also had some fluke chirashi, which was just fun, and then some pork in a polenta which I loved way too much. For dessert, they had a cucumber mousse paired with these little fruits called “mouse melons” and not only did it taste super fun and weird, but it was just wicked cute and made me happy.\n\n**FANCY SPOTS**:\n\nCAMILLE’S:\nUndeniably and without a doubt the best meal I’ve had in Providence. Eating a meal here is better than having sex with someone who makes you feel comfortable and can get you to cum multiple times. The food here was so good it made me angry. I’m still angry thinking about it right now. I don’t really know what to tell you except, yes. Grrr.\n\nWATERMAN GRILLE:\nI think this is probably the second best meal in Providence that I’ve had. Like most places that are sill-ily fancy, they change their menu up pretty frequently, so I don’t have any recommendations, but I remember getting this really killer crispy duck dish with some sort of cherry flavor somewhere in there, and I think there might have been some risotto involved, and I’m just telling you there was a lot of wow up in all of that. On top of the good food, if you reserve it, you can sit outside with a really amazing view looking right out onto the water. Highly recommended.\n\nTHE DORRANCE:\nI think I’m putting this one in as the third nicest meal I’ve had in Providence. The interior decor is really something else, and the cocktail menu is fun, quirky, and kick’s the ass of just about all other restaurants I’ve been to. As is the norm, the menu changes too quickly to give any recommendations, and annoyingly enough, it’s wildly hard to find any sort of current menu online, but their pasta really didn’t disappoint, and I remember them having a large selection of cheeses if you are the type to be so inclined.\n\nOBERLIN:\nFancy small plates, best shared with a date. While they don’t have any special cocktails, they do have the classics along with a large sake list and some fun beers and wines. I went long enough ago that I don’t remember what I ate, but I do remember that I had a really great experience and would do it again. The menu is notably different from anything else in the area, and I also just have a soft spot for places where you’re expected to order multiple small dishes. If you’re looking for a really filling meal, you won’t get it here without dishing out a lot, but for a fun special occasion, it’s worth it.\n\nROOFTOP AT THE PROVIDENCE G:\nReally cute! Great vibe! Outdoor rooftop seating with fire pits if you want! Strong drink menu and fun but pricey eclectic fair. They’ve changed the menu since I went, but when I was there I went for the beetroot gnocchi and really enjoyed. If I recall, this place is just fancy enough that they’ll turn you away if you’re wearing sneakers and a t-shirt. Overall, fun fancy date night spot or place to grab cocktails with friends around the fire pit on a special occasion.\n\nCIRCE:\nReally nice atmosphere and fancy vibe inside. I had some gnocchi and enjoyed it greatly, but I think I’d need to go back before making any definitive conclusions about the menu as a whole. That being said, in terms of percentage of the menu that sounds appealing to me, Circe beats out most other restaurants by a good bit! For whatever reason, I don’t feel as strongly about it as I do most of the other things on the “fancy” list, but it really is a good meal and worth checking out.\n\nLOS ANDES:\nAltogether a solid fancy spot that’s good for a date or going with a couple friends who feel the urge to splurge. Dimly lit, solid vibe. Good wine and a lot of different options to choose from. It’s also pretty fancy without completely breaking the bank.\n\nPersonal Favorites:\nThere’s just really a lot of good entrees to pick from, but to start out, definitely go for some form of ceviche, and if you’re not a picky eater, the anticuchos\n\nHEMENWAY’S:\nUndeniably a great experience, although if I was looking to blow some cash on a nice meal out, admittedly not my first choice. The tuna tartar kicked some serious ass, but was super small. I’m a sucker for oysters, and they didn’t disappoint. The drink menu was fun. All in all, highly recommended, but just not as highly recommended as the other fancy restaurants around here.\n\nThat’s it!

The vast majority of those things are pretty non-controversial, and if I wrote about them, I think most people here at Brown would tend to agree with them. On the flip side, I have pretty much just one reasonably strong view that I do think is kind of controversial and that people at Brown potentially wouldn’t agree with too much. I wanted to write it here, not to stir any sort of pot, but hopefully to start some sort of conversation or hear an opposing viewpoint that changes my mind. So here it is:\n\nWords matter. A lot. And in particular, the way that we label people and the specific labels that we use are really important. \n\nIn general, people on the left know this really well -- we know that there’s actually a really important difference between calling people intersex versus hermaphroditic, we know that getting someone’s pronouns right really matters, and we know that the labels we give things and people, and the exact wordings of those labels are incredibly important. They shape the way that we view people and issues.\n\nTo that end, I think it’s really great that the left, in general, does a good job of being cognizant of the words it uses. One area that we don’t do such a good job with this, though, is when it comes to labeling people in negative ways --- when it comes to assigning a label to people who have done something wrong. Based on the CW, you might be thinking that this is about to turn into some big rape-apologist, racism-defending cold take. I really hope not! I just have a few thoughts that I think are important when it comes to how we handle labeling people in negative ways.\n\nIf you’re going to assign someone a negative label, it’s best if that label captures two things.\n\n1: Intent\nWhen someone does something bad, the intent behind their actions is really important. In general, we all know that. A good example of this is Good Samaritan laws, which protect people who accidentally hurt someone while trying to save their life. The classic example here is that someone gets into a car crash, is rendered unconscious, and then the car starts smoking as if it’s going to catch on fire. A bystander runs to the car and carries the person’s body from the wreck, not realizing that they suffered a spinal injury from the crash, and now because they moved them, they’re paralyzed for life, and in the end, the car never catches fire anyway. \n\nWe all tend to agree that even though the person’s actions directly caused someone to be paralyzed for life, they did the best that they could, and because their intent was in the right place, they shouldn’t be punished. That's why Good Samaritan laws were created. Even if you subscribe to the idea of “Impact over Intent,” you’ll probably agree in cases like this that intent really matters when figuring out how to treat people or figure out their punishment.\n\nNow, imagine what would happen if none of our negative labels for people took intent into account. In this case, we wouldn’t differentiate between things like murder and manslaughter. If you accidentally killed someone, we’d just call you a murderer, because you killed someone and that’s that.\n\nI imagine that if you accidentally caused someone’s death and were labeled a murderer, you’d probably spend most of your time trying to convince people that you didn’t deserve to be called a murderer. You’d view it as unfair. If you got out of prison, no one would want to associate with you, and instead of feeling bad about what you did or trying to change yourself in any meaningful way, you’d instead just spend all of your time being angry and telling people that you don’t deserve the label you were given. Because at the end of the day, there really is a huge difference between premeditated murder and manslaughter.\n\n2: Severity\nNegative labels should also try to have some notion of severity tied into them. Shoplifters who steal a pack of gum are a world’s away from bank robbers who’ve committed grand theft or first degree larceny, for instance.\n\nNow imagine a world in which we didn’t make such a distinction, and we treated shoplifters identically to how we treated bank robbers. Maybe you have a young rich kid who stole something small just because they wanted to and felt entitled. If they’re caught, that potentially can be a really teachable moment. They get labeled a shoplifter, and someone tries to set them straight so they don’t do it again, and they feel bad about what they did.\n\nOn the flip side, if they get pulled aside by a cop and get labeled as a grand larcenist, instead of trying to change in any meaningful way, they’ll probably lawyer up, deny that they did it, and do everything in their power to make people not view them that way so they don’t suffer the consequences.\n\nNow, at this point, you likely know where I’m heading with all of this. I think we could legitimately get a lot more done when it comes to racism and rape culture in America if we worked on our negative labels a bit more. I don’t want to be a defender of bigots or a rape apologist, and I’m really not -- any way you spin it, rape and racism are awful things and the racists and rapists deserve to be punished. But the logic of “They did something wrong so they don’t deserve any sort of consideration or leniency” is the logic of the right, not the left. The left is about understanding that people who do horrible things are still people, and that we should make sure that we’re always careful in making our punishments fit the crime. We’re also supposed to be the side that cares more about reforming people and making the world a better place than punishing people and delivering judgement. \n\nSo what I’m saying here is that racists are bad. No question, no brainer. But you’ve probably seen jokes on the internet or videos to the effect of “People act like calling someone a racist is more offensive than actually being a racist in the first place.” It begs the question, why do people get so up in arms when you call them out on racism? People often say it’s because white people are fragile or entitled or can’t accept that they’re in the wrong or imperfect, and honestly, sure, that’s all part of it! But a pretty large part of that might also be that we’re using the same word to describe hardcore left-leaning people who unknowingly commit microaggressions as we are to describe members of the ku klux klan!\n\nIt goes without saying that the a lot of people get away with being racist in America without any consequences, and that even when there are consequences, they pale in comparison to the reality of the oppression that pretty much all oppressed groups face in America. It’s also reality though, that pretty much none of us would want to be friends with someone that everyone knew was a racist -- that if we hear someone is a racist, we think they’re a bad person -- that, on rare occasion, people get doxed or lose their job for racist remarks. In general, that’s fair! Being a racist is bad! If you’re really being racist, you maybe should be fired, and you’re an asshole! \n\nBut if someone tries their hardest to be an ally to the black community and stands up to racism whenever they see it, then accidentally does something slightly racist because people make mistakes, it’s not honestly that wild when they get super defensive when someone tells them they’re being racist. That’s the word we use for people who actively hate black people. That’s the word we use for people who should be fired from their jobs and for people who we all agree are morally bad people. If someone doing their best is called a racist, instead of hearing out what the person calling them out has to say and then trying to be a better person, they’re probably going to shut down, become defensive, and make no real change to who they are as a person.\n\nYou might be inclined to say “Yeah, well that’s on them. They’re a racist. They fit the bill, we’re going to call them that, and if they’re too caught up in being defensive to listen and make changes to their behavior, then that’s on them, and they’re a racist. It’s not my fault they’re being racist, and it’s not on me to try and treat them more kindly, especially when they’re not treating others with respect.” \n\nThat’s a fair and logically coherent standpoint. It also is a standpoint that shows you care more about labeling people in ways that make you feel better than you do about making an actual impact on social issues and helping people change their ways. If there were a word for “racist, but to a lesser extent” or “racist, but accidentally,” then I think instead of getting really defensive all the time, when you told someone they were being accidentally racist, they’d say “Wow, I totally didn’t realize. Thanks for pointing that out, I’ll try to do better in the future,” which, unless you’re an asshole who gets off on feeling politically superior to people and loves calling people out, is supposed to be the major goal when you point out someone’s bad behavior.\n\nOne step more controversial, I really think the same applies to the word “rapist.” Rape is legitimately one of the worst things a person can do, and I think if you rape someone, you should be seriously punished. At the same time, when I was a kid, the first time I heard the definition of “rape,” the picture that came to mind was someone assaulting a stranger in a dark alleyway. When I got a bit older, I realized there were other types of rape, like drugging someone’s drink. For a long time, that was always how I viewed rape -- as something premeditated, where you know without a shred of a doubt that what you’re doing is horribly wrong. But then I learned more about consent culture and sexual assault in general, especially in the wake of recent events, and realized that rape was a lot more broad than I ever imagined as a kid. Rape is buying someone drinks until they’re really drunk, and then even if they say yes to having sex, they’re too drunk to give consent. Rape is being with someone who's into you, but pressuring them or guilting them into doing more than they want to. Rape is when someone’s really into you and you’ve been seeing them for a while, you’re hooking up, you say “let’s have sex” assuming that if they don’t want to, they’ll say no, but they don’t because they freeze, and you didn’t ask for active consent.\n\nYou might be satisfied lumping all of those together and saying “Yes, all of those people are rapists. That’s what it means to be a rapist is that you raped someone, and not asking for active consent is rape.” And that’s totally fair. But there’s something really messed up if we’re not trying to make some sort of distinction between the premeditated creeps in the first instances and the person in the last case who possibly doesn’t even realize they’ve done anything wrong. I’m not defending or apologizing for rapists -- it’s an awful thing to do no matter how you spin it, and people shouldn’t walk of scott free regardless of the circumstances. But if we didn’t lump all of this together, I really believe that you wouldn’t hear as much shit from yuck-creep guys like “You can just stare at someone the wrong way and that’s considered rape this days,” or “My son won’t even go on dates anymore because he’s so afraid of people wrongly accusing him of things nowadays.” There potentially should be different words that capture the severity and intent of the act, and also different courses of action depending on the case.\n\nAnd, in truth, I think when we start differentiating these sorts of things, it really helps the victims of sexual assault too. Imagine a case like the last one above where someone knows and likes their assaulter, and the assaulter doesn’t even know they did anything wrong. In cases like these, pretty much all the victim’s options are awful. They want to make sure that the guy knows he did something wrong and doesn’t do it again, but they also aren’t looking to seriously punish him. They could tell him about it personally, but that’s traumatic and putting too much of a burden on the victim. They could tell other people or pursue legal action, but they either won’t be believed and face backlash, or they will be believed and the guy will get in more trouble than they really wanted in the first place. If victims could choose between legal action or something milder like anonymously reporting someone so that they’d have to complete a program aimed towards education and reforming so that they know what they did and would never do it again, with serious consequences if they get referred more than once, I think the rate at which people report sexual assault would go up, a lot of victims would feel more comfortable with their options, people would actually change, and our outlook on rape culture would be a lot better than it currently is.\n\nNone of that’s to say that people who knowingly commit rape should be getting off easy, or that victims should feel pressured into giving someone a lighter punishment than they deserve. As said above, I’m not apologizing for rapists or saying they don’t deserve to be treated harshly, and it should largely be up to the victim to decide on what sort of punishment their assaulter deserves. And some people should definitely be called a rapist and be given no sympathy or room for reforming. But in cases where it’s clear that someone will put in the work to change, regrets what they did, and didn’t mean for it to happen in the first place, it’s still awful, they’ve still traumatized someone, and they still can’t take back what they did, but the “rapist” label that lumps them with the same creeps who do much much worse is just going to make them defensive, bent on discrediting the accuser so they don’t face consequences, and unwilling to change.\n\nThat’s about it. This is a really un-Brown University kind of take, and I’m sure a lot of people won’t really like it. As said above, I don’t really want to apologize for rapists or racists. The oppression faced by minority groups and the trauma faced by sexual assault victims is generally much worse than anything that the racists or rapists ever face. But at the end of the day, I think words matter, we’re using the wrong ones, and while it might make us feel better, it’s hindering social progress. I think we could actually make some headway on changing people’s bad behaviors if we worked on the language we use, and we wouldn’t have to let anyone off the hook or be extra lenient on abusers or racists to do so. I think at the end of the day, it would even make things better for a large amount of racial minorities and sexual assault victims by giving them more options on calling things out without receiving backlash or facing someone who’s defensive. I don’t know what words we should be using -- we’d probably need to make some new ones. And this obviously isn’t the most important social issue out there, and isn’t as important as other racism and rape related issues like believing survivors or holding racists accountable. But it’s real, we don’t talk about it, we contribute to it, and I wanted to start a conversation. If you disagree, by all means, write a comment or another post. I’ll keep my eye on them and I’m more than willing to hear criticism on this or accept I’m wrong if I am, and if I got anything wrong or parts of this were offensive, that, of course, wasn’t really the goal here, and I apologize. Hopefully though, this gets people thinking and starts a conversation about actual ways we can reshape the way we think about issues like these.\n","date":"Jan 17, 2019, 4:48 PM"},{"content":"1178 - Sick of all the AirPod memes.

Buxton responded aggressively on social media when the suspension was declared, attacking people who agreed with the hazing and sexual assault problems. \n\nThis past December, a Brown student had her drink spiked at a Buxton party. She ended up unconscious with other serious physical symptoms and was forced to go to the hospital as a result. Several other people have posted serious allegations against Buxton:\n\n\"I (female) rushed buxton and was asked in an interview which of my male interviewees I would sleep with, I was asked to imitate my roommate having sex, and I was asked my favorite position.\"\n\n\"Some of those rumors are definitely true. I rushed Buxton and we had to do the “imitate your roommate having sex” thing. I’ve heard other terrible things from other people who have rushed. Buxton really needs to improve its toxic culture and address these problems instead of pretending that everything is okay.\"\n\nThe president of the organization posted the following in response to the evacuation order: “Hi. We were charged with alcohol being on our premises during spring weekend and they felt like it was justification for expedited action to move us out of our dorms mid semester. Also, the vast majority of people who currently live in the house were not members of Buxton during the time this incident took place.” \n\nThis announcement hid other issues claimed against Buxton. The president's official apology statement in response to the suspension was posted as a comment on a meme, suggesting that it was not being taken seriously. Other responses by Buxton community members have ignored the serious allegations and called them \"\"generalizations\"\" or simply false. This is unfair and must be dealt with as Brown's administration sees fit.\n","date":"Jan 17, 2019, 4:43 PM"},{"content":"1170 - Pros and cons of rushing a sorority?\n","date":"Jan 17, 2019, 4:42 PM"},{"content":"1169 - i am a non-black student. i am currently registered for a seminar through the africana studies department. i have never taken an africana seminar before. i really want to learn the material in the course, but i am worried about taking up space since it's a capped course. any advice?\n","date":"Jan 17, 2019, 4:42 PM"},{"content":"1168 - Hey, this is going to be my first time taking a WRIT course and I'm just generally really confused by how writing samples work?

I’m the person that made that post about science (how it doesn’t have evidence for its own philosophical precepts, how scientific theories don’t correspond to truth, etc.)\n\nI’ll be honest... I made that post mostly to bait STEM people, hoping that some of them would reply to the post. I also picked pretty ~daring~ claims. Just wait until you see what Paul Feyerabend has to say lmao. That said, I’m happy that most people did respond to my claims without being dismissive because I genuinely want to respond to the comments and have a discussion (even though having a discussion in an anonymous page is pretty tough tbh). \n\nThis post will address a response to my post and provide some more context to the claims I made previously.\n\nOne person said that “Scientific theories are observations that have been shown to work time and time again. Nothing is proven by the scientific method but instead it garners support.” I agree, for the most part, with the latter part of this statement. I don’t really agree with the former. From a historical perspective, having scientific theories that “worked time and time again” was pretty rare. There are so many examples of people believing in a certain theory because the data they had fit their conceptual framework, only to be completely disproven because of x, y, or z.\n\nThomas Kuhn argues that “scientific fields undergo periodic \"\"paradigm shifts\"\" rather than solely progressing in a linear and continuous way, and that these paradigm shifts open up new approaches to understanding what scientists would never have considered valid before.” Scientists operate under a certain paradigm for some time and “as anomalous results build up, science reaches a crisis, at which point a new paradigm, which subsumes the old results along with the anomalous results into one framework, is accepted”. However, Kuhn also argues that competing theories/paradigms are incommensurable, which is to say that “it is not possible to understand one paradigm through the conceptual framework and terminology of another rival paradigm.” And so data from the older theory usually doesn’t usually “subsume” into the newer theory.\n\nIt’s important to note that there have been many paradigm shifts throughout scientific history, and each time this happened scientists would essentially have to start over with a new paradigm/theory. I guess what I’m trying to get at here is this: to believe that science progresses linearly, every day getting closer to “the truth,” is dangerous. There is no guarantee that the paradigms of today won’t undergo a crisis.\n\nI also agree with the last part of the person’s comment. Of course, science and other fields rely on axiomatic assumptions, and they’re the best we’ve got at the moment. The problem is when, suddenly, certain assumptions we thought were axiomatic turn out to be false. Then we’ll be in trouble.\n\nOk, phew. I’ve noticed that I spent a long time talking about a single comment by one person, and that it’s pretty hard to talk about Kuhn without writing lengthy responses like this one. People write books about this shit so it’s hard to summarize a position and make sense at the same time, but hopefully I made some sense. I’ll be back to respond to other comments in another post.\n\nLastly, read Kuhn and Feyerabend!!\n","date":"Jan 17, 2019, 4:41 PM"},{"content":"1157 - If the students in buxton are getting kicked out and I have a vacancy in my double...does that mean I’ll probably get a roommate?

This conversation is so so so important and i don’t think it happens at brown much. I’ve had to talk to racists and sexists all my life and it SUCKED, but I learned to respond to an offensive opinion with fake-interest. LISTEN to what they think, and then you will understand WHY they think it. Only then can you inform them or try to change their mind. If you respond immediately by treating them as inferior or prevent them from speaking in the first place, they will never change. Have empathy and put yourself in the offenders shoes. Maybe they have that shitty belief because they were taught it by their parents and it’s their second nature and hard to shake, or because they come from a conservative place like me where it’s the norm and they genuinely don’t know any better, or because no one has ever been willing talk to them about it and everyone immediately dismisses them as obviously wrong and stupid.

It often hinges on the insistence that antisemitism is no longer an extant or widespread issue, playing into centuries-old stereotypes and conspiracies that Jews are a privileged and powerful group. In reality (as many commenters have already noted) there is huge racial and cultural diversity among Jews, and they face varied forms of discrimination including being targeted by neo-Nazism and white supremacy, to the point of mass violence, Holocaust denial, and calls for genocide.

To that end, I figured that it wouldn’t be all the bad of an idea to share some of those things that I’ve learned in case anyone else could benefit from them. I can’t really fit everything into one post, but I figured over the next few weeks I might as well write everything up in sections and post it on here. Always feel free to write a comment if there’s anything you want to add to or disagree with. With that all said, here’s the first section!\n\nPost 1: Not Treating Your Body Like Total Shit\n\nA very large portion of the people I know in college are unhealthy to the point where not only does their body not function in exactly the way they want it to, but also their focus, energy, and overall brain-power takes a big hit too. Some of us are well aware of how unhealthy we’re being. A scary portion of us, though, don’t even realize it. I’m writing this so that everyone who really needs to take better care of themselves has some tippers to go off of, but also so that people who aren’t that healthy might have some sort of “trigger” to realize it. \n\nI think to a large extent, a lot of people are unhealthy because we overestimate how much we’re able to neglect our bodies and have them still function properly. Equally so, I think many of us didn’t come into college well prepared to fully take care of ourselves. At some point, we were all used to having a fixed schedule, a lunch period, and for a fair amount of people, family dinners or breakfasts. Moving into a world in which we fully control our sleep schedules, diet, alcohol consumption, and considering there was no class we had to take or manual we had to read about how to best go about taking care of ourselves in healthy ways, it’s not really that surprising that a lot of us fail to do so too well.\n\nMaybe the roughest thing about staying healthy is that it’s not always that clear when you’re failing to do so. In general, no one’s grading you on the sort of health choices you make, and it might not be obvious that you’re not being healthy until you realize you’re waking up every day feeling sluggish and low on energy. Even if you never hit that point, a lot of people feel “fine” without realizing how much better they’d be feeling and performing if they invested a bit more into their health.\n\nTo that end, as someone who had long periods of college in which my health went to complete shit, here are a couple of tippers on staying physically healthy. Note, a lot of the effects of not treating your body right, such as low energy or inability to focus can also be due to mental health related issues instead of physical ones. I was going to talk about both of those things, but the post ended up being a bit longer than I wanted, so this is mostly about physical health, and I’m hoping to make another post about mental health a bit later.\n\n1: Don’t make excuses.or convince yourself that you’ll figure out your health later\n\nWhen thinking about personal health, it’s common for people to think something along the lines of \n\n“Yeah, I know I’m not honestly that healthy right now, but it’s fine. I lived this way in high school and I still did well enough to get into Brown. I’m also not that bad. If I ever feel myself getting really unhealthy, I know I’ll figure my shit out then.”\n\nor\n\n“My health has been taking a lot of hits lately, but I legit just don’t have the time to fix it. If I actually got a full night’s sleep every night, I’d never finish half the stuff I needed to get done. I’ll try to worry about it more when I have the time.”\n\nThe truth of the matter is that you can be pretty unhealthy without realizing it; health is a habit, and the occasional all-nighters and unhealthy choices you used to make in high school weren’t nearly as bad as the chronic bad choices you might be making now; getting healthy will make you more productive, less tired, less stressed, and in the end, pay back a lot of dividends in terms of getting things done; and it doesn’t take all that much time to stay healthy in the first place.\n\nIf you know you’re not too healthy, the right time to change that is almost always the present. If you’re not sure if you’re being healthy, the right time to figure that out is pretty much always the present too. Don’t give in to trains of thought that might tell you otherwise. *Please* let 2019 be the year you start to treat your body right, because you deserve to feel healthy!!\n\n2: Don’t glorify being unhealthy\n\nA lot of people have a habit of “showing off” how unhealthy they are, as if it’s some sort of thing to be proud of. For example, you might hear people telling you how little sleep they’ve gotten or how many all-nighters they’ve been pulling for a project. They might also talk about how much coffee they’ve been drinking lately. For some reason, a lot of people seem to view never sleeping and being a caffeine addict as personality traits or things that make them quirky or differentiate them from everyone else. In some sense, that’s understandable! These sorts of things are often correlated with drive, dedication, a strong work ethic. On the flip side, this is legit super awful and anyone doing this should maybe one-hundo-p stop it right now! Just to throw it out there:\n\n_Being unhealthy isn’t a personality trait. \nBeing unhealthy isn’t something to be proud of. \nBeing unhealthy isn’t something something to glorify and isn’t worth showing off_\n\nIf you realize that you do this, considering doing not that! If you see someone else doing this, politely let ‘em know that glorifying unhealthy choices is kinda, like, not v cool, and that you care about their health and want them to make healthy choices! Yay social accountability!\n\nPast those two tips which are largely focused on how we _view_ health, there’s also a lot of more specific advice that pertains to actually being healthy. I’ve known people who don’t eat nearly enough each day, half the things they do eat are Baja’s nachos, their sleep schedules are abysmal, and when they do drink liquids, half the time they’re coffee, booze, or soda. The remaining tippers are some things that you should be caring about and watching out for.\n\n3: Oh my lord, drink some fucking water, please, your body is BEGGING you\n\nAs someone who went through most of my life being miserably dehydrated without realizing it, I’d like to let you know that you should actually drink water. Wild! You will feel _so_ _much_ _better_ if you’re actually consuming enough water each day, and your brain and body will thank you in ways you can’t imagine.\n\nTo that end, I’m just going to categorically say that if you don’t own a water bottle, then that is *bad*, and you are wrong. \n\nBring it to your classes. Bring it to the dining halls. Keep it in your backpack so it’s everywhere you go. Fall asleep cuddling it. Whatever it takes so that you always are drinking water!\n\nIf you “don’t like water” or other water bottles haven’t worked out for you, try one of the autoseal ones at https://bit.ly/2MbwOE5. I dunno what it is, but they really kicked my butt into drinking large amounts of water and enjoying it. I just ended up liking water and drinking way more of it out of one of them than I do out of a glass or any other bottle. Plus, if you want to show some school spirit and dish out more cash than you really should have to for a water bottle, the book store also has one of these in red with the Brown logo on it.\n\nAt the end of the day though, this is generally one of the things that people in college suck at the most, but is the easiest to fix. I also want to reiterate that I went through almost all of my life being wildly dehydrated and didn't have a clue, so if you're thinking \"\"I don't drink much water, but I'm fine,\"\" actually, you're totally 100% wrong! Wild! And once you start drinking enough water for a few weeks, the difference is noticeable and you will feel super cool! So plz drink more water! Plz!\n\n4: Get enough calories each day\n\nA lot of people “forget” to eat, or just don’t eat enough each day. A lot of people also view it as too much of a hassle (especially in the upcoming winter months) to get to one of the dining halls or to make a trek out to a grocery store. At the end of the day, though, if you’re not eating enough, your body will be very _sad_.\n\nIf you’re eating one meal a day, don’t! If you’re eating two meals a day, still, probably, don’t! Try counting calories for a day or two, and if you end up well below your daily recommended, maybe it’s time to make some major changes to your eating habits! Additionally, if you realize that the majority of what you eat doesn’t contain enough nutrients or any form of vegetables in it, you should also consider making some serious changes to your eating habits! There’s a strong chance you don’t appreciate just how directly your diet correlates to your energy and happiness, but wowie, it really does!\n\nThe best way is to actually eat more real food, and to have that food be at least moderately healthy and rich in the things your body needs. If you’re off meal plan, veggies aren’t too expensive and there are a lot of nice ways to cook em up that taste really good.\n\nIf you know you’re not going to listen to any of this advice because you’re shit at making yourself do things you don’t want to do, like getting out to dining halls three times a day, restocking your fridge, or cooking anything substantial more than once every 24 hours, then consider stocking up on meal replacement solutions.\n\nYou’ll probably feel better eating real food, but at the end of the day, if the two options are not eating enough, or consuming a lot of clif bars and soylent, you reaaally should choose the latter. I strongly recommend stocking up on some clif bars and soylent if you don’t think you’re eating enough, even if you just eat one a day to add onto your normal diet, you’ll probably feel a lot better. \n\nClif has, like, 30 flavors, a lot of which are pretty tasty, and while the original soylent tastes sort of like chalk, you will be annoyed by how much you don’t hate the chocolate and vanilla flavors. They also have caffeinated versions if you want to get some nutrients into your system with your morning coffee. Better yet, you can buy them both online, and they’re honestly pretty cheap! Drinking 5 regular soylent per day, for instance, costs under 15 bucks! If you know this is what you’re going to need to be a real person and stay healthy, legit just go buy some this very instant at https://www.clifbar.com/shop and https://soylent.com/products/drink-original. \n\n5: Consider sleeping\n\nNot really much to say here. You know if you’re not sleeping enough. In personal experience, this one has never made my body feel like total and utter shit to the same extent as chronic malnourishment or chronic dehydration, but your body will still feel a lot better if you’re consistently getting enough sleep, and if you’re so busy that you just _can’t_, then let’s be honest, there’s a strong chance you have too much on your plate or aren’t managing time very well.\n\n6: Reduce the booze\n\nA lot of people think that if you drink a lot, the health concerns are just feeling like shit the next morning and a minorly increased chance of cancer down the line. As someone who has “experimented” with this claim quite a bit, please let me tell you that this isn’t true! If you’ve been drinking a lot lately, chances are your body would feel a lot better if you cut back or stopped, even if you don’t currently have any alcohol in your system.\n\nWhen I overdo it with the alcohol, I usually end up with some moderate brain fog, headaches, and trouble digesting most things fully or properly. And, in general, I just feel sluggish. As much as I hate to say it, severely reducing alcohol intake will just make you feel a lot better, health wise, in general. So if the bartenders at the GCB know you by name, or you find yourself partying hard every weekend or on weekdays too, not to be the bearer of bad news, but, maybe, like, don’t do that so much, or go out as much as you currently do, but only have one or two drinks instead of enough to get you near brown-out levels.\n\n7: Do some form of physical activity\n\nThere’s a strong chance that you’re someone who doesn’t work out and who lives a largely sedentary life, because, tbh, you’re at Brown, and most of us are sedentary nerds. If that’s not you, fantastic, you’re doing great sweetie, keep doing what you’re doing! \n\nIn general, even if you didn’t get much of a work out before coming to college, as you get older, your body is probably going to hate you more and more for doing nothing active. (And hey, gym class was a joke, but, I mean, it was more than a lot of us are doing nowadays.) \n\nMaybe you hate going to the gym, either because it’s far, or because it’s awkward to be there because everyone else is there and can judge you. Maybe you’re not overly athletic and have no desire to join any kind of sport. That’s okay! If you feel comfortable going to the gym, I’d recommend it. At the very least, though, there’s a lot of not-hard and not-embarrassing stuff you can do from the comfort of your own room. I’d personally recommend doing something like a pushup challenge. I’ll personally be doing the one at https://hundredpushups.com/ as a New Year’s Resolution, because when I’m actually super buff, it’s gonna be ~over~ for you all!\n\nThat’s it for the tippers, so all I want to leave off on is that your health is actually really important. It’s probably a lot more important than you’ve been giving it credit for. Not just because you might get sick way down the line if you’re not being healthy, but because each and every day it factors into all of the things that you probably care about. Are your grades hurting because you’re finding it hard to focus or because you don’t feel smart enough? Are you low on energy sometimes or can’t find the motivation to do anything? There are multiple reasons things like this can happen, but often, it’s just because you need to treat your body better.\n\nSo really, please, do some soul searching. Figure out if you’re actually treating your body in a way that’ll let it function. If not, I’m rooting for you! I hope 2019 will be the year that you start to be a ‘lil healthier! That’s all.\n\n-me\n","date":"Jan 16, 2019, 1:51 PM"},{"content":"Hi! As is probably evident, moratorium is over and we’re back to posting more controversial content.

When speaking of the border, I believe a nation has the sovereign right to dictate who enters and leaves the country. America is a nation of immigrants and need more of them to strengthen the country. I just believe the government should not give any individual an unfair advantage of any sort. I think the following quote resonates quite deeply with me: \"\"We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked, and circumventing the line of people who are waiting.\"\" \n- Barack Obama \n- I don't think our current border is failing miserably. No, even as a moderate conservative, I do not support the idea of building a wall, especially with our taxpayers' money. However, the idea of abolishing the border does really concern me as it will open up doors to not only good immigrants who are willing to work hard to attain the American Dream, but also toxic people who will cause more harm than good. \n- I fundamentally believe that the U.S. should give its best effort to ensure the safety of its citizens, just how we lock up our houses during the night to protect our loved ones from any intruders.

This pledge is thus still an undergraduate at brown and is a danger to girls on campus.\n\nAt the same time as this was occurring, lantern was having sexual assault workshops and seminars—they didn’t work! lantern’s/phi psi’s history of sexual assault has carried into the present and the pledge continued to attend lantern parties.\n","date":"Jan 16, 2019, 12:45 PM"},{"content":"1075 - Let’s be clear—what happened in phi psi/lantern in the past is continuing into the present\n","date":"Jan 16, 2019, 12:45 PM"},{"content":"1074 - in regards to the anti-semitism posts coming up: can someone explain the israel palestine conflict quickly? super briefly and simply please, i know nothing about international relations\n","date":"Jan 16, 2019, 12:44 PM"},{"content":"1073 - You have no idea how comforting it is when people comment on my Blueno posts that they’ve been through exactly what I’m going through.

I almost switched concentrations because I couldnt take the embarrassment that came with retaking the intro sequence especially because I made such a serious mistake. \n\nAnyhow, the department assured me I didn’t have to stop studying what I came here to study, and they encouraged and supported me despite my blatant dismissal of their rules, so I sucked it up and retook the intro sequence. I can’t even count the amount of times people brought up the fact that I was in 17 when they took it, but eventually the year was over and despite my terrible GPA and lost year— I still ended up with a couple of cushy internship because somehow, someway I showed promise, and you will, too!!!\n\nIf you finished 15/17/19, that’s amazing as it is.

(e.g. if you forgot the first step of the Calvin cycle, you need to go back and memorize the entire Calvin cycle). then, when the test bank answers are released, check your personal answer key against it. if you got anything wrong, that is a SERIOUS RED FLAG, go talk to a TA or the prof about it to clear up any misunderstandings. \n(5) memorize the answers to all of the test bank questions (& variations.) \n\n---\nYou do NOT need to memorize every single slide. You do NOT need to go to every TA session (although if you learn best through TA sessions, definitely go for it!). You do NOT need to read the textbook. You don't even need to go to class (but you really should because it's incredibly hard to pay attention to 5 consecutive lecture captures.) \n\nIf you don't have time to do all five of these steps, here is how I would rank them in terms of how necessary they are: (5) , (1), (3), (4), (2) \n\nof course, YMMV.

So I guess my question is twofold: \n\n- Is it possible to still make it in the department despite struggling my way through the intro class? The hardest part of the course for me was the final when all I had to rely on was myself, which made me realize that I had been leaning too heavily throughout the course on my project/lab partners and TAs. I'm scared that my grades will only drop as I go into upper level coursework and start to take courses where all the work is individual.\n\n- Would it be worth it to switch to a more writing-heavy major since that is what I excel at, for the sake of GPA?

Here’s the problem with that: it can’t just be “your” lifestyle if your lifestyle hurts others, is discriminatory in favor of a certain group of people, and is generally denigrating and disrespectful of its rushees. First, anybody can rush Buxton, so you have a responsibility to answer to the community. Second, you are the only international house on campus so often people associate being international with the culture of Buxton. And third, we are all Brown students here, so what y’all stand up for reflects on the whole community. It’s important that Buxton recognizes these issues and addresses them in the right ways, because having a house that has a lifestyle like Buxton’s on Brown’s campus is a black spot. I have nothing against people having similar lifestyles living together, partying together, or even doing drugs together. But wtf is with Buxton’s elitism, the open show of affluence, and the deliberate exclusion and denigration of those who don’t live like that? And when I say this I’m not talking about how many Buxton folks are on financial aid. I’m talking about the choking claustrophobic aura of whiteness and wealth that the people in this house exude. Y’all not recognising this and defending Buxton, instead of taking steps to change the house y’all love so much is just as much a part of the problem as the real issue.\n","date":"Jan 8, 2019, 11:10 PM"},{"content":"884 - chill econ electives?\n","date":"Jan 8, 2019, 11:10 PM"},{"content":"883 - what is summer session like?\n","date":"Jan 8, 2019, 11:10 PM"},{"content":"882 - how do i get a finance internship??\n","date":"Jan 8, 2019, 11:09 PM"},{"content":"881 - brown is supposed to be the “wholesome” ivy but it sounds like there is just so much judgment by people at brown - no wonder there are first years scared to come out of their shells if they can be quickly written off for owning a certain brand of clothing (aka socioeconomic status) or coming from a certain state/country, etc. just let people be, they might surprise you for once\n","date":"Jan 8, 2019, 11:09 PM"},{"content":"880 - can we stop making blanket statements about groups of people on campus and stop making assumptions about people?

Previous posts were simply pointing out that genetics CAN be the cause of one’s weight and that you can’t assume someone’s health simply by looking at them. This still holds true. But trust me, most people who are overweight know that its because of their lifestyle choices. Rather than point out the obvious “solutions” such as simply eating better or going to the 3 gyms on campus, maybe ask yourself why people aren’t already employing these solutions. For the gym, let me ask you if you’ve ever been to a gym while overweight? People stare, people laugh…yes even at Brown individuals get ridiculed. It can be an intimidating environment and it’s not just as easy as taking an hour out of one’s day to go. I see that you like to include research to back up your claims, so maybe try to research the connections between obesity and socioeconomic standing in the United States. Especially look at research that follows changes in our food industry within the past 30 years (yeah I don’t think anyone is blaming the spike in obesity on genes that have changed in the past 30 years. Nope that’s the changing food industry). Those who are wealthier are generally able to afford healthier, more expensive food and health care that can certainly translate into ones weight and the ease in which they can maintain this healthy weight. Dining hall food isn’t always the healthiest and diverse in selection which can make eating healthy for those with dietary restraints even more difficult. Furthermore, students might be burdened with on campus jobs and time commitments that might make it literally impossible to have the free time to go to the gym. And no, if you’re already working non-stop and sleeping very little, I don’t think just waking up an hour earlier and somehow making time is always possible. Being extremely overweight is not usually healthy, you are right about that. But rather than having approached the topic from a place of concern for the health of your friends and classmates, you approached it from a selfish place only discussing the financial burden imposed on you by individuals who are overweight. So rather than simply telling people to stop complaining and fix their lifestyles, why don’t you use your time more productively; see how you might be able to help fix some of the problems discussed above that continue to keep overweight individuals overweight.\n","date":"Jan 8, 2019, 11:01 PM"},{"content":"826 - I’m 19 and haven’t gotten head at Brown yet.

I’m not a member, and am actually a female identifying individual who—like your friend—is a victim of sexual assault at Brown. I am also not trying to speak for other survivors, this is just my personal opinion.\n\nI have absolutely zero intention of invalidating your friend’s experience and there is no circumstance under which assault is ever okay. It’s abominable and disgusting.\n\nI can’t speak to your friend’s experience, but I do know that Lantern is taking action against sexual violence and has been.\n\nTheir leadership seems really hypersensitive to stuff like this precisely because of their history and association with sexual assault. People have been prevented from joining the fraternity and coming to their parties if they have made anyone uncomfortable.\n\nI don’t think it’s fair to say that their parties are inherently unsafe for femme-identifying individuals, as they have put mechanisms in place for sexual assault prevention at their parties specifically. They have members wear glowing wristbands at parties so that people can know who to go to for help, be it a sexual assault situation or someone needing to get EMS’d etc.\n\nPhi Psi is the only fraternity with a set of rules explicitly posted on their Facebook events including on stating that they require all consent for all activities.\n\nThey have a specific position of leadership that deals with sexual assault prevention. This position is charged with educating members on sexual violence prevention and consent, and even their pledges this year had a seminar on it.\n\nAnd as for the “lawlessness” of Lantern due to their unofficial position, I do think that they have more of a reason to abide by school rules precisely because they want to regain the recognition and trust by Brown as an institution.\n\nI’m not saying that Phi Psi is all good, however, I do think that Lantern is seen as the logical scapegoat for the 2014 case when in fact they are now taking concrete steps to confront sexual assault. None of those men who were a part of the organization at the time go to Brown anymore. Today it’s a whole new group of guys. Guys who are extra conscious of the situation and who have striven to make tangible changes.\n\nAs for your friend, I encourage you, if you feel comfortable, to anonymously report to Phi Psi about who the perpetrator is. I strongly believe that they will do their best to investigate, but knowing the identity of that brother is the first step to getting your friend the justice they deserve. I would also suggest your friend reach out to SHARE if they haven’t already.

And when 70% of people in this country are overweight, that's a problem. Stop with this bullshit that all fat people are genetically predisposed to it. Fat shaming is terrible, Fat pride isn't good either. The reality is that obesity is not generally not healthy, and that for most people a healthier diet and exercise will help you lose weight. This is not always the case, but it is often. People at Brown, with access to at least 3 different gyms, as well as healthy eating options around campus, have very little excuse to be fat. Not all of you on campus are actually fat because of genetics, stop pinning it on that instead of taking responsibility.\n\nThe idea that obesity is often related to genes is cool, until you actually look at any of the evidence. In 1990, obesity by state ranged from about 7-15%. 30 years later, it's from 22.6-38.1%. It's laughable to suggest that our genes have so dramatically shifted in the last 30 years. No, this is more indicative of our eating habits. Not all people have the ability to lose weight, but many do.

Many people seem to think that racism is simply prejudice based on race, but that’s such a flawed and problematic way of looking at it. Oppression is inherent in every institution, every community, every situation. Equally problematic is a lack of understanding of the intersectionality of oppression. Many factors contribute to how oppressed a person is. For example, we cannot talk about fighting racism without considering the unique systemic oppression of queer/trans/gay/non-male black/Latinx/Asian folks. I would encourage Brown students to broaden their definition of “oppression” and “racism” and to understand how complex these issues really are.

The ta hours are generally attended by everyone and super helpful, and the homeworks *can* be long and difficult. However, it is a great class and there are a decent number of resources to help you succeed. The course is scaled at the end (in my opinion, pretty fairly), so it is quite possible you may think you are doing worse than you actually are. In my opinion, I would suggest taking it for a grade because generally if put effort into the homeworks, there is great chance you will walk away with an A or B. Also, from my experience, I wouldn't necessarily let how you do on the first (or first couple) of assignments necessarily convince you to S/NC the class, just because if you don't have prior experience with the course material, there is a bit of a learning curve, but you can still do very well.

I hope the clerk gets the proper help he needs, because he must have been struggling through a lot, god bless him. \n\nBut are we really in the state of America where you can wear Trump gear, and have all kinds of stereotypes automatically placed on you, without any degree of proof other than wearing a shirt or hat? I hope our state of politics can return to one where you can healthily discuss and debate without being assassinated socially.\n\nSure, supporting Trump might imply you're an actual fuckwit, but it could also mean you agree *most* with his opinions, but not all (especially those that are problematic), with no other politician coming close to your beliefs. If you can prove someone's racist, a misogynist, etc, do it by actually looking at what they've done, instead of a hat they wear (because you can support someone politically without supporting them socially -- which is why I voted for Hillary, although I hated her personality and didn't agree with her opinions on social stuff). \n\nIf you've been friends with someone for a long time, and you think they're absolutely amazing, they're kind, they're always respectful of peoples' beliefs and decisions, and they've never been problematic, but you find out that they voted for Trump today, would you stop being friends with them? If so, perhaps re-evaluate your perspectives. There are excellent people on all political spectrums, and being on a different spectrum doesn't mean someone's wrong or misguided -- it simply means they have a different perspective than you. If you want to convince them of yours, don't yell at them or call them names; explain your point, listen to their perspective, and see if common ground can respectfully be found.\n\nTL;DR: I hope one day in the near future we can be friendly with each other again while talking about politics, and respectfully disagree, without needing to throw tantrums.\nUpdated Dec 31, 2018, 7:07 PM\n","date":"Dec 31, 2018, 7:07 PM"},{"content":"583 - loona for sw\n","date":"Dec 31, 2018, 7:07 PM"},{"content":"582 - anyone here over winter break? ive been so lonely sitting home by myself everyday.\n","date":"Dec 31, 2018, 7:06 PM"},{"content":"581 - Shoutout to Brown students doing ROTC.

So I enter this house and the living room is packed with people who are having a fun time, and folks are playing beer pong on the left side of the room. But the first thing that caught my eye was a fucking huge American flag that covers up an entire wall of the living room. I get the goosebumps. \"\"Hmmm an overt display of patriotism days after Trump was elected? This is sketchy,\"\" I thought to myself...\n\nAnd then my worst fears were confirmed. I swear to fucking God - the moment I walk in - Mr. Brightside by The Killers starts playing. Almost everybody in the living room knows the lyrics and when the chorus kicks in they all start jumping and screaming/singing in unison - beer cups in hand. \n\nNow, full disclosure: I'm an international white dude. And the stereotypes of American frats that were seared into my brain after all those years of watching American college movies were confirmed in that very instant. Like a prophecy. \n\nIt was too late now. There was no turning back. I'll never unsee that sight. I'll never unthink those thoughts. It felt like I was in movie set where every white person was playing a parody of themselves. \n\nAnyway, as I try to follow one of my friends to the other side of the room, I get stopped by a guy who asks \"\"Who do you know here?\"\".

I’ve submitted a couple of the posts on here that could be considered “conservative.” None of what I posted was particularly controversial at least in the comments section, but much of it was stuff that I probably wouldn’t say at Brown in person. Before you call me out for using anonymity to say things that I wouldn’t otherwise say, I want you to know that this page has actually allowed me to understand the liberal side of things. If this page didn’t exist, I wouldn’t put my views out there out of fear of how people would look at me for having a contrasting viewpoint. I’d quietly hold onto my views while pretending to side with the majority. But being able to submit these posts has given liberals the chance to challenge my beliefs, and this has led me to change my mind on certain issues.

Data across the country suggests that this is the case too. Isn’t affirmative action meant to “right the wrongs of the past” in a sense? Haven’t Asians also been systematically oppressed (e.g. Japanese internment camps, etc.)?

If you want to reduce bias and harassment, you need better training and oversight. Investigate officers who’ve been accused of misconduct, and fire them if the allegations are accurate. Spend more time training new and current officers on concepts like unconscious bias that influence the way they do their job. Encourage officers to identify problematic coworkers and bring them to the attention of management. Hire officers from more diverse backgrounds, and seek out applicants who’ve studied subjects like sociology that give them a deeper understanding of policing in America. All of these things can improve how DPS does its job.\n\nSo why shouldn’t they also be disarmed on top of these other changes? If DPS were disarmed, that would mean that armed Providence Police would have to respond to any potentially violent incident on Brown’s campus. The presence of armed, Brown-trained DPS officers would simply be replaced with armed police officers from the Providence Police, a department that has faced allegations of misconduct in the past. That’s not something you want if you’re trying to protect students from unfair policing. \n\nRather than totally eliminating armed police, we should find ways to keep them accountable. For example, maybe we don’t want them patrolling dorms unless they’re called for an emergency. That’s a reasonable proposal. But disarming them doesn’t get to the root of any problems, and it could actually create new ones.\n","date":"Dec 19, 2018, 7:49 PM"},{"content":"447 - people who talk in quiet areas in libraries (even if it's just a quick hi) make it really hard for folks like me to get through finals\n","date":"Dec 19, 2018, 7:49 PM"},{"content":"446 - Does anyone know what a S* means for your final grade, is that S with distinction?\n","date":"Dec 19, 2018, 7:49 PM"},{"content":"445 - I'm dreaming of the day when the funny quotes page returns to the Critical Review.\n","date":"Dec 19, 2018, 7:48 PM"},{"content":"444 - What weekend is spring weekend 2019?\n","date":"Dec 19, 2018, 7:48 PM"},{"content":"443 - This girl is dating my ex (he’s my friend and we’re cool) and I really want to be friends with her because she seems cool but I’m scared of coming off as creepy.

I know that I contribute to these images too- I’ve posted a fair amount about all of these things- and it is hypocritical of me to call out other people when I’m part of the system. I wish there was a way in which we were constantly reminded of the weight of our guilt, or at least of the guilt that we are complicit in, as we go about doing other things in our lives. I wish that we would remember that every second we spend wrapped up in our petty lives, is a second of silence and complicity in the deaths of people who don’t have the agency or the ability to speak up like we do. Every time we push “politics” away because it cuts into our normal life, I wish we could remember that it is privilege to not have politics constantly invade our normal lives. For some people, normal is waking up to sounds of gunfire, not knowing whether they’ll come home that evening, or walking down the street knowing that anyone can pounce on them and rape them and the world will blame her for wearing what she was wearing, or not having enough money to eat two meals a day, let alone three. I wish people living in this bubble that is Brown- a place that celebrates and produces privilege and elitism, that is oddly, a tad more socially conscious than the kind produced by other similar schools- understood how much we need to do and how much power we have to do it. It’s not enough to volunteer at a refugee program once a semester, or go for a protest once a year, or share a Facebook post once a day. Our breaths, our sheer existence is swathed in the guilt of the capitalism, colonialism and suppression that our people have benefitted from, and we must spend every second of every day actively resisting that - both internally and externally. It’s not our choice, it’s our duty.\n","date":"Dec 15, 2018, 3:54 PM"},{"content":"343 - Hey, I'm a sophomore and I need friends.\n\nThanks,\nSad lonely sophomore\n","date":"Dec 15, 2018, 3:54 PM"},{"content":"342 - Hi freshman here!

To be clear: this is NOT the fault of the TA's or really any student lead part of the course. The TAs are great and I admire them for the work they do. The issue I take is more with the structure of the class itself. When students are lined up 50 deep 15 minutes before hours start in the CIT, this should be worrying. When TA's need to hold \"\"break out\"\" sessions almost every time that TA hours are held because too few students understand the material, this should be worrying. When people are in TA hours for an hour (as opposed to the allotted 15 minutes), this should be worrying. The lack of assistance and vagueness to the projects has left many people (from what I gather here on this page) including myself, turned away from the idea of taking computer science again. Since I assume this is not the point of this introductory class, I think some changes need to be implemented. Since no rant is really constructive without some sort of solution, here are some that I believe could help alleviate these issues.\n1. Consider breaking the class up into two semesters. Projects would not be as rushed and neither would lectures (throw back to the lecture where Andy skimmed through 40 slides and told us to look them up on our own time).\n2. Cap classes! The large class size inflames the problems that exist within the course.\n3. NEVER NEVER say the course has \"\"no prerequisites\"\" if the pace is maintained. The idea that someone can come in to CS15 having no experience is astounding. The amount of time spent on stack overflow and code academy just to try and decode the lecture slides far exceeded what it should for an \"\"introductory class\"\".\n4. Increase TA numbers. I know there are several issues within the department where there is not enough funding, so I understand how this may not be able to be fixed (see no. 2 for alt. solution).\n5. Eliminate the favoritism for those who sign up in the CIT. Students tend to line up much earlier before the actual hours begin because they fear that they will be told that they are \"\"after the end of the people who can be randomized\"\". The necessity to sign up in person means that often it is 15-20 minutes before people can actually get randomized.\n\nThanks for reading my rant. I will not be continuing my path with CS but I hope that some people who read this might understand what they are getting into before they sign up next year.\n","date":"Dec 14, 2018, 10:57 AM"},{"content":"325 - my roommate who is studying comp sci told me that i shouldnt be allowed to complain about how much work i have because i'm concentrating in humanities. i love what i'm studying but it did not feel too good to be told that :/\n","date":"Dec 14, 2018, 10:57 AM"},{"content":"324 - Wtf is that squeaky sound near Caswell\n","date":"Dec 14, 2018, 10:57 AM"},{"content":"323 - Guys, I'm really feeling defeated in Chem 0360.

I should say, I’m not coming from a place were I feel “pressured” to lose my virginity. I’ve thought it through for myself and I don’t. I just want to jump that hurdle and be able to enjoy sex with the v word is out of the way.

Waiting for hours and hours every day only to be seen 15ish minutes, not being able to go far from the CIT, or constantly having to check the lines to see how many people are before you are all stressful. It’s also completely understandable for you to feel a lack of support. I feel it every day, especially when I’m stuck and can’t do anything about it, because I know Googling will not get me anywhere and talking to other students in the class can be like walking on a landmine because of the collaboration policy. It’s also frustrating when you see other students very obviously breaking the collaboration policy but get away with it. Either way, the list goes on. The tasks are difficult and the working conditions are stressful. That being said, I just want to say that blame shouldn’t be placed on either yourself or the CS department. It’s unfair to allocate all your blame on one or the other. I know it’s difficult, but I know you’ll get through it. If you’ve don’t, that’s also okay!

The posts complaining about CS aren’t really complaining about the nature of the department, in my opinion (although things can always be tweaked for improvement) - they’re just reflections of the fact that CS is freaking hard and that sometimes, even with all the support in the world, you’re just going to have to struggle through an assignment.

Like a sub-page of Dear Blueno tailored to CS students. I mean, I'm no CS student, but the CS posts (besides the admiring ones, of course) fill me with such concern that I feel like we need a platform exclusively for them to handle their expansive quantity of issues. That's not to say that other departments couldn't make use of a specific complaint/problem-based platform, too. But, damn it, I can't go five posts (whether in the old BBA, the new one, or even this new page) without seeing something CS-related and I'm just like, \"\"OMG what is up with this department? Why are so many students complaining and their complaints seemingly not addressed? Because if they were, they'd stop being so frequent on the single most popular FB page among Brown students. This clearly isn't a Brown thing, or even a STEM thing. It's a CS thing, and it needs to stop.\"\" I'm sure the apparent volume of the CS department's problems are partially a consequence of the sheer size of the department, and I already know there's a group of students dedicated to improving the overall atmosphere of the department (I'm not very familiar with your work, as I don't do CS, but I'm sure it's great--the fact that you exist is a step in the right direction). But seriously, can we just take a minute to talk about this, and why it keeps happening with seemingly no loss of momentum? I know APMA has this problem, too, but its usually just 1650. There are plenty of ways to deal with a mess as isolated as a single course. But CS isn't just a single course; just to name some problematic courses off the top of my head, I've seen an abundance of posts complaining about 15, 17, and 33. And, perhaps, I have no right bringing light to an issue I have no business dealing with, but I believe my position as an outsider speaks to the fact that this problem (or series of problems) is too large to be confined to the common knowledge of a single department). \nOf course, the above sentiment should be taken with a grain of salt, as I'm assuming every post is written by a distinct person, when it could just be the same handful of people complaining about different but related things (one of the downsides of anonymous platforms like this one is that you can't use them to gauge the extent or popularity of an issue, and so \"\"objects in the mirror are closer than they appear\"\"). However, I still believe talking about the dysfunctional nature of one department has its merits. And it's not something only \"\"CS-students\"\" should have to deal with, but something all students who've had any experiences with or within the CS department should be involving themselves in. Why leave it a CS-community issue? Why not promote it to a Brown-community issue?
