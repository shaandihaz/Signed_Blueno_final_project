And not the most beautiful, most popular girl in a given community, but rather the charming one who listens to his problems and laughs at his jokes, someone assertive and funny and opinionated and someone who will make the first move. I love watching romantic movies, but I want a story that I can relate to. There seem to be many movies that show a wide range of feelings and emotions in females, but I want to see one that also shows these feelings and emotions in males; we have feelings too!

2018-09-16T23:49Z,170,,"this is an admirers post for all the first years out there. i'm a junior now, and i remember my first september on brown's campus really well. i'm not gonna lie - it kinda sucked. i felt really lonely, extremely homesick, and very out of place. shopping period and class registration stressed me the fuck out. i had a rapid onset case of impostor syndrome that i could not shake. i felt like i'd conned my way into this school, like i'd somehow gamed the system. the other students in my seminars were outrageously bright - they were making references i didn't understand, they were cool as cucumbers during in class presentations, they made the professor laugh. meanwhile, i choked on my words every time i had to say anything in front of a group larger than 10, and i slowly started feeling like my educational background was completely useless, like my high school teachers had let me down by failing to teach me things these other kids knew. i looked around and felt like every other kid i'd met had found a solid, beautiful, funny, fun-loving group of friends. the type you see in the movies. and i hadn't found that. at all. i had acquaintances, i felt, but no one who liked me more than that. i wasn't invited out very frequently. i didn't feel appreciated. i didn't feel like i mattered here. 

and to top it all off, everyone else i spoke to or met seemed to be having the total opposite experience - if it wasn't the best week or month of their life, it was surely the best year. 

i'm here to tell you that if you're feeling lost, or scared, or homesick, or sad --- trust me when i tell you that there are others feeling the same way. more than you know! i found that, come second semester, more and more people were admitting to me that they'd spent nights crying in the bathroom when they felt unprepared for an exam, or saturdays in the library or their rooms, having not been invited to a single party. 

i'm writing all of this because i remember how desperately i had wished for someone to write something like this for me back when i was a first year. how desperately i just wanted one person to admit that adjusting is hard, and that sometimes it might take 2 or 3 months, or even 2 or 3 years! 

if you're a first year having the best time of your life this month - i applaud you! that's sick, and i'm really happy for you. but if you're not...i'm here to tell you that i didn't, either. and that this september feels about 500x better than that first september did. i admire you guys so much. adjusting is fucking HARD! and you're doing it! as hard as it may feel. you're all amazing and totally worthy of being here at Brown. in your own special ways.",

2018-09-24T17:52Z,319,,"To clarify about 302, I was talking about the kind of people who might spend at least $100 every time they go grocery shopping, every two weeks that they go, while I'm just with them, buying a box of blueberries that I know I can get cheaper elsewhere, that I know I'm only buying because I'm embarrassed not to buy anything. People who always complain about the 'Financial Struggle™ ' whenever it comes up in conversation with friends who are actually struggling. People who say they really need to work extra shifts this semester but won't bat an eyelash spending more than two hundred dollars for a single night stay in a hotel room """"because it was too much of a hassle to wait in the airport for the 2AM flight"""". People who don't have to calculate every time they look at a menu because they're not thinking about how much is in their bank account or how they have to pay off their credit card. The list goes on.
Like I was trying to comment on people at Brown who are actually okay money-wise, like they know it, AND act like or sometimes outright lie that they're also struggling financially. I'm not sure if it's their twisted way of being sympathetic or whatever, but my actual struggles are not an opportunity for people like that to throw themselves a fake pity party. Like it's not a bad thing for people to have nice things, regardless of where they are with money, but lying about how textbooks are so expensive when you bought a new pair of Coach shoes to add to a literal collection is not okay. Money issues are real things people go through, literally every waking moment, and anyone who fakes it for some sick satisfaction in playing a victim is not only disrespectful but probably has their own stuff to work through.

You probably think that one campus using plastic straws will make a minimal difference in the long run. You're right. But in order for us to move to a sustainable future, we have to start somewhere. It's not just about pretending we care about the environment to make ourselves feel better (though you're right, we probably do that sometimes). It's about making people aware that a bunch of small things can lead to big changes. First it's paper straws, maybe one day all of our disposable utensils are biodegradable.

Basically yeah, I know the paper straws suck to drink out of (no pun intended). But we have to take small steps before we can make big changes.

And who knows? In a few years someone will probably develop a biodegradable straw that isn't awful!!",

I just want to say (as a person who has been involved in making decisions for several clubs) that it is actually a shitty process. It matters a lot whether you know someone in it, whether they like your attitude, whether you made an awkward face or said something mildly awkward, etc. I have had people reject applicants for the pettiest reasons (including not being smily enough or being awkward while greeting the people in the room). People claim that Brown is a place where you can try new stuff but tbh Brown has limited so many of my hobbies because I was not amazing at them. I have been rejected from so many clubs that I truly wanted to participate in and learn more about merely because I was not freaking AWESOME at them. My advise? If those !@#$%^& do not believe in you, YOU believe in yourself. Do not quit, do not give up. Find a group of people and do it independently. Do not let petty stuff get in the way of your passion.",

Running over the same old ground

2018-10-03T22:45Z,617,,"I'm admiring my new baby orchid but I also wanted to share some tips:

1. Don't top water your orchid. Phalaenopsis orchids grow upside down in situ, meaning water runs out of the main crown of the plant and water build-up can rot and kill the orchid. Pour water into the media and over the roots. Allow water to completely drain from the pot and don't leave the orchid sitting in standing water. 
2. Ditch the moss, and invest in some epiphytic orchid media. Anything that is nutrient-poor, loose and airy works (just google orchid bark). Don't use potting soil. Phal roots grow exposed to the air and need constant air flow to not suffocate, so moss is a generally terrible idea.
3. Don't expose the poor thing to full sun. Seriously, don't give your plant sunburns. We haven't invented lather-on plant sunscreen yet.
4. Green roots = happy and moist, Silvery-gray roots = dry and sad. Orchids don't like being dry and sad
5. Polish the leaves. They get caked in dust so keep them nice and shiny.
6. Don't chop off the weird, noodly things that grow from the sides of the plant. Those are its aerial roots and are very important to the plant. It's like cutting a guy's dick off. Don't do it. 
Abuse your baby, and your soul will be forever tainted with the stench of death.

I do the course purely because I like it and I'm trying really hard. When I ask you to explain stuff to me the second time, please don't eyeroll. That fucking hurts. It's ironic because you didn't get my explanation the first time either. Also 'HOW DO YOU NOT SEE IT?' isn't the nicest thing to say.

I know that CS is this next big thing and people who do it feel good, but please don't make outsiders feel so shitty when taking your course, especially when it ain't even a low level course. Can I design a finite state machine that makes this course less of a humiliating experience?",

From an interesting article I found: """"considering that one developmental goal of college is to explore your own identity and sexuality in relationships with others, those individuals who put off their first kiss might be setting themselves up for sexual adjustment difficulties later in their adult years. Furthermore, not having kissed by the time it is normative to do so could indicate a larger pattern of inhibition and withdrawal from close relationships...""""

To everyone else reading this: emotions are absolutely a valid response to recent events, but that is likely not going to change anyone’s mind. If you want to convince people to agree with you, you have to understand where they and their difference of opinion come from.

I’d have thought this goes without saying at a place like Brown, but posting things like “Indian women on this campus are hot” or “Asian guy in my CS15 class is cute” is normalising attraction based on race. It can offend the people you admire to feel that they are nothing more than their race to you. That’s not only institutionalised racism but that’s also you invalidating a person’s individuality, and reducing their identity to a race/ethnicity and you have no right to do that, not even if you identify by that same race/ethnicity yourself. You can’t presume to know someone’s identity by their physical appearance- calling them out on that, even in a positive way, may not be the best idea, and definitely not the best idea for a BBA post. As a woman of color, I’m constantly concerned about whether I’m being fetishisized by someone I think likes me, or am actually liked, and posts like these make me highly uncomfortable as I’m sure it does other people.",

As a former Meiklejohn for three years and a former TA of two of the largest introductory classes at Brown, I’ve witnessed people transition from uneasy, insecure first-years to ridiculously successful graduates. And by “ridiculously successful,” I don’t necessarily mean they’ve had to have found a cure for ALS or Parkinson’s or whatever. I mean that I have yet to look at a SINGLE former student of mine and think to myself “wow this person hasn't made any progress” because the obvious truth is that every one of them has made enormous progress. You might not recognize it yourself, but other people absolutely do. I hope you have the faith to believe that you will make a difference. If you’re a first-year, you have quite a way to go, and if you’re a senior, chances are you’ve already come a long way without realizing it. I continue to be proud of you and my alma mater ❤️",

2018-10-16T13:05Z,1239,,"I hooked up with a guy for the first time last night. He was gentle and sweet and very respectful of what I wanted. In many ways, the encounter was perfect- the straight out of movies kind of perfect. I knew going into it that it was just a hook up, and I knew when we decided to see each other again, that we would just do that because we enjoyed the sex. And yet, my heart feels empty and somewhat heavy- almost as though something is horribly wrong. Usually I am sad when I like people who don’t like me back, and I can put my finger on in the exact moment, the exact instant and the precise cause for my sadness. But something about this situation makes it different. It’s not that I feel attached to him, nor do I regret that night. I also do want to keep hooking up with him and other people. Yet why does it feel that isn’t how it was supposed to go down? Why can I not accept that all those little gestures and moments that only happen in sweeping tales of romance, are nothing more than an empty physical, with no heart? I mean i understand that heteronormativity is a social construct, and marriage and monogamy are all constructed, so why can my heart and head not reconcile? Why can’t I give up on those idealistic notions and take what’s given to me?",

I was hungry, sad, and irritable, and I tried to still remain respectful of my TA, but I was just too exhausted to try. I'm sorry to the TAs whose feelings I may have hurt as a result of my non-CS related life problems. I feel really guilty about being so rude, but after waiting for so long and still getting no support, I was frustrated and on the verge of giving up.

I am a CS15 student and I'm struggling in the course due to the collaboration policy mixed with the lack of TA hours. I keep not being seen because I cannot put my entire night on hold just to wait for 15 minutes of office hours - and the new hours policy has made it worse. As a result my mental health and grades have gone down, but I cannot drop this course for other reasons. I have tried asking the TAs what to do and I was either told that everyone struggles (all the more reason to do something about this class) or to talk the the HTAs. I emailed the HTAs asking for help and explaining that I - and anyone with other commitments - can't reasonably do all of this with the very limited resources they give us and only 24 hrs in a day. I even made suggestions of small steps that would help. So far they have yet to respond to me. 
I know I am not the only one who is being actively harmed by and is not ok with this class. Does anyone know what I can do and/or to whom I can go. I am really struggling and am really sick of being ignored by a class """"open to everyone"""". Any advice for me or any other student feeling this way would be greatly appreciated.
Lastly, a huge thank you to all CS15 TAs! You are the reason anyone passes this course! I know you put up with a lot and are short-staffed, you are all saints!",

2018-10-22T00:25Z,1542,,"So I've got this theory (this is especially for my underclassmen but also whoever needs it) that absolutely no one on this campus has a fantastic perfect amazing life and NO ONE'S reality is as beautiful and lovely as it is presented on social media. No one's. 

What I've come to find in my time at Brown (and it's taken A LOT of time and energy and sadness to find this) is that if someone isn't struggling socially, they might be struggling academically. And if they're not struggling academically, they're probably struggling with extracurriculars. And if that's not a struggle for them, then job and internship-hunting is. And if they seem to be perfect at that, I can guarantee you that they're having an issue with their concentration or their friend group or their family or their finances.....the list goes on. And very very few people will cop to any of these issues, especially publicly. Which makes us all feel like we're behind in a race that doesn't even exist! 

The point I'm trying to impart (especially to our younger students on campus) is that the person whose life you see on Instagram, who you envy, who seems to have endless supplies of whatever it is you're looking for (whether that's friends or parties or money or good grades or job offers or success in extracurricular endeavors) - I absolutely, unequivocally guarantee you that their life is much harder than it appears to be. So please don't waste your energy comparing yourself! I wish I could go back to my freshman or sophomore self and capture back alllllll of the energy and time I spent worrying about how my life stacked up to everyone else's, because as I spoke to the people I envied so much, I always came to discover that they were either struggling in a very silent way or even envied some portion of my life! 

Let's all be a little easier on ourselves, please!",

Ouch. Sounds like you're having a tough time. That sucks. I've been there, so I kinda know what you're talking about. I've been in the ever circling vortex of self doubt, frustration, and loathing. It's no bueno. I know. If you don't mind lemme tell you a couple things. You can read em if you want, read em again later if you feel like it. But honestly man, if I spend all this time typing this out to you and you don't let it be a little tinder for your fire, well, you're just letting us both down. And you don't HAVE to do that. You don't HAVE to do anything. But you get to choose.

(Who am I? My name’s Alex and I’m a freshman. Just moved to a new city for a dream job that I got because of the rules below. I owe a lot of my success to people much cooler, kinder, more loving and greater than me. When I get the chance to maybe let a little bit of help out, it’s a way of thanking them. )

Rule numero uno - There are no more zero days. What's a zero day? A zero day is when you don't do a single fucking thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on. No more zeros. I'm not saying you gotta bust an essay out everyday, that's not the point. The point I'm trying to make is that you have to make yourself, promise yourself, that the new SYSTEM you live in is a NON-ZERO system. Didnt' do anything all fucking day and it's 11:58 PM? Write one sentence. One pushup. Read one page of that chapter. One. Because one is non zero. You feel me? When you're in the super vortex of being bummed your pattern of behaviour is keeping the vortex goin, that's what you're used to. Turning into productivity ultimate master of the universe doesn't happen from the vortex. It happens from a massive string of CONSISTENT NON ZEROS. That's rule number one. Do not forget.

La deuxieme regle - yeah i learnt french. its a canadian thing. please excuse the lack of accent graves, but lemme get into rule number 2. BE GRATEFUL TO THE 3 YOU'S. Uh what? 3 me's? That sounds like mumbo jumbo bullshit. News flash, there are three you's homeslice. There's the past you, the present you, and the future you. If you wanna love someone and have someone love you back, you gotta learn to love yourself, and the 3 you's are the key. Be GRATEFUL to the past you for the positive things you've done. And do favours for the future you like you would for your best bro. Feeling like shit today? Stop a second, think of a good decision you made yesterday. Salad and tuna instead of Big Mac? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Was yesterday a nonzero day because you wrote 200 words (hey, that's all you could muster)? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Saved up some coin over time to buy that sweet thing you wanted? THANK YOU. Second part of the 3 me's is you gotta do your future self a favour, just like you would for your best fucking friend (no best friend? you do now. You got 2. It's future and past you). Tired as hell and can't get off reddit/videogames/interwebs? fuck you present self, this one's for future me, i'm gonna rock out p90x Ab Ripper X for 17 minutes. I'm doing this one for future me. Alarm clock goes off and bed is too comfy? Screw you present self, this one's for my best friend, the future me. I'm up and going for a 5 km run (or 25 meter run, it's gotta be non zero). MAKE SURE YOU THANK YOUR OLD SELF for rocking out at the end of every.single.thing. that makes your life better. The cycle of doing something for someone else (future you) and thanking someone for the good in your life (past you) is key to building gratitude and productivity. Do not doubt me. Over time you should spread the gratitude to others who help you on your path.

Rule number 3- don't worry i'm gonna too long didnt' read this bad boy at the bottom (get a pencil and piece of paper to write it down. seriously. you physically need to scratch marks on paper) FORGIVE YOURSELF. I mean it. Maybe you got all the know-how, money, ability, strength and talent to do whatever is you wanna do. But lets say you still didn't do it. Now you're giving yourself shit for not doing what you need to, to be who you want to. Heads up champion, being dissapointed in yourself causes you to be less productive. Tried your best to have a nonzero day yesterday and it failed? so what. I forgive you previous self. I forgive you. But today? Today is a nonzero masterpiece to the best of my ability for future self. This one's for you future homes. Forgiveness man, use it. I forgive you. Say it out loud.

Last rule. Rule number 4, is the easiest and its three words. exercise and books. that's it. Pretty standard advice but when you exercise daily you actually get smarter. when you exercise you get high from endorphins (thanks body). when you exercise you clear your mind. when you exercise you are doing your future self a huge favour. Exercise is a leg on a three legged stool. Feel me? As for books, almost every fucking thing we've all ever thought of, or felt, or gone through, or wanted, or wanted to know how to do, or whatever, has been figured out by someone else. Get some books max. Post to about BBA about struggling with friends? Good first step! (nonzero day, thanks younger me for typing it out) You know what else you could do? Read 7 habits of highly successful people. Read """"emotional intelligence"""". Read """"From good to great"""". Read “thinking fast and slow”. Read books that will help you understand. Read the bodyweight fitness reddit and incorporate it into your workouts. (how's them pullups coming?) Reading is the dang warp whistle from Super Mario 3. It gets you to the next level that much faster.

That’s about it man. There’s so much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days, but that’s not your mission right now. Your mission is nonzero and forgiveness and favours. You got 36 essays due in 24 minutes and its impossible to pull off? Your past self let you down big time, but hey… I forgive you. Do as much as you can in those 24 minutes and then move on.

I hope I helped a little bit max. I could write about this forever, but I promised myself I would go do a 15 minute run while listening to A. Skillz Beats Working Vol. 3. Gotta jet. One last piece of advice though. Regardless of whether or not reading this for the first time helps make your day better, if you wake up tomorrow, and you can’t remember the 4 rules I just laid out, please, please. Read this again.

Have an awesome day ☺

tldr; 1. Nonzero days as much as you can. 2. The three you’s, gratitude and favours. 3. Forgiveness 4. Exercise and books (which is a sneaky way of saying self improvement, both physical, emotional.",

For everyone who is going to sit in their rooms alone and hear everyone else having (what seems like) a good time. Big party weeks like this can SUCK for a lot of people. 

As an offering of hope, I want to say to all those people (especially first years) - I had a HORRIBLE Halloweekend last year. No one invited me anywhere. I had maybe 2 friends on campus at the time, and they either didn't want to do anything or were going out without me. I sat in my room, alternating between crying and scrolling through Instagram looking at everyone else having the best time. 

This year I've already had a blast doing things with new friends I've made! It definitely gets better. 

And guess what? If it doesn't? Halloweekend isn't actually THAT fun. You aren't missing much! Half the time I just wish I were in my room watching TV. People construct false realities on social media. I've been to some grungy, humid, nasty, boring basement parties that have been filtered into oblivion on Instagram. Suddenly they seem like the party of the century. But they weren't. 

Either way, I'm with you! Please don't lose hope or feel too bad. There are soooo many kids like you on campus!",

2018-10-29T16:57Z,1996,,"This is an admiration post for everyone who’s not really happy here at Brown. It kind of pains me to say this, because as much as it might be comforting to hear, it’s also a pretty bleak statement about the culture here, but, you aren’t alone.

I’m writing this post in hopes that in putting some of the negative things I feel about Brown into words, I might reach some sort of catharsis, and I’m hoping if you’re not doing so well right now or if any of this resonates with you in some way, this might be a bit cathartic for you too.

I’ve been here for about three years now, and naively, I keep expecting each new semester to be the one where I suddenly become happy, where I find friends that make me excited to wake up every day, or where I finally, if not start to love my life, at least find a bit of peace and contentment. I keep being wrong. 

For a while, I wondered if this was due to some personal failing of mine. Maybe I just didn’t fit in here. Maybe I was just too flawed to exist in a space like Brown or to warrant happiness here. And in full honesty, there might be a shred of truth in that: I’m not a perfect person. I have a lot of things that I can work on and a lot of room to be a better. Because of that, I worried that my unhappiness had just become a fact of life. That it was independent from Brown. That, barring some major self-transformation, I’d remain equally dissatisfied for the foreseeable future. 

At the height of this all, my health went to shit. My energy plummeted. I began to wonder if I had depression. And more than anything, I just needed a break.

So I took one.

I left Brown for a while, and, while it didn’t happen instantly, I felt better. I made a ton of friends I genuinely enjoyed being with. Most days, I woke up pretty excited. I grew a lot. I learned a lot. I felt healthy. And when it finally came time to come back to Brown, I was a bit anxious, but more so than ever I was hopeful. After being happy for so long, I could hardly imagine that it wouldn’t carry through to school. I was ready to be happy here at Brown.

I was wrong.

What I ended up realizing is that Brown just isn’t really a place for me. 

To some extent, I’m happy that I ended up here, because I really have been getting a great education, and I think it’s going to do me well after college is over. In truth, though, if I had a do-over, it’s not that I would come to Brown and just do things differently, I just wouldn’t have come to Brown in the first place.

Some cynical part of me wants to say that it’s the people here. Because I’ve met so many bitter people here at Brown. People who are constantly trying to prove something, people who need to feel like they’re superior to you, people who never learned healthy social habits and who think they’re too smart to be at fault or need to change. Most of all, people who are also unhappy, but have been taught that their own self-care is more important than being a decent human being and people who encourage them to continue believing that.

And, honestly, I feel like there’s more than a shred of truth in all of that. And that there’s dozens of other issues with how people at this school act that I could rant about for days. But I don’t think that so many people here would act in these sorts of ways if there weren’t a deeper problem with the culture here in general. So, most of all,

I don’t like Brown because it’s not valid to be unhappy here. 

I think maybe it’s because Brown has the reputation of being such a happy place. It’s because when you take the tour here, everyone is smiling, and people will shout at you that you should come here, and you’ll love it. But the end result is that when we feel unhappy here we tend to think there’s something wrong with us or that we don’t belong here. And when we’re sad and feel like there’s something wrong with us, it’s pretty easy to be bitter. It’s pretty easy to try to latch onto anything that makes it seem like people like us more.

But even more so, I don’t like Brown because it’s so easy to be lonely here.

Maybe that’s why so many of us are sad in the first place. Despite being surrounded by people all the time, despite having periods of my college life where I’ve had a lot of friends, I never really found people I actually felt comfortable opening up to or that I was able to really get close with. I’m not completely sure why. Maybe it’s because we’re all putting on acts and don’t like the acts that everyone else is putting on. I don’t know.

What I do know is that I’m not unique in any of this. The number of people who’ve eventually revealed to me that they’re unhappy here has been staggering. The number of people who’ve told me they suffer from serious anxiety and depression which got worse when they came here, the people who’ve told me they engage in self-harm, the people who’ve told me they felt suicidal or have attempted suicide while here. It occasionally leaves me wondering if Brown is really the place for anyone.

I hope it is. I hope that there are a bunch of people out there who are happy here and have managed to be happy without hurting other people or making them unhappy instead. I tend to believe this less and less the more people I get to know.

In any case, though, know that if you’re not doing so well at Brown, you’re not alone. You’re not an anomaly or a freak. Being sad here doesn’t mean that there’s something wrong with you or that you don’t belong here. I’m not telling you that it will pass or that if you’re sad here, it will eventually go away, but despite the fact it often doesn’t feel like it, this is the beginning of our lives, not the end or the peak. If you’re thinking about taking some time off, going abroad, or even transferring, that’s more than valid. If you need to take one fewer class or take something S/NC because you’re extra low on energy this semester, that’s valid too.

For me, I’m going to keep on hoping and doing my best to make each semester be the one that finally makes me happy here. I don’t really think it’s going to happen, but hey, I don’t have too many more to go. But really, more than anything, I just hope you all find a bit more happiness here than I did.",

2018-11-02T16:45Z,2218,,"I’m a little worried about showing up to CS15 TA hours tomorrow. I came to hours a couple times very recently and although it was super helpful as always, I was unable to meet minimum functionality for DoodleJump by the on time deadline and will now have to submit it by the late deadline. I worry that tomorrow and/or day after my questions won’t be appreciated as most everyone else coming to hours will be getting a head start on Tetris, and internally the TAs will think that I should’ve gotten this done earlier. I can’t help it though as I just had an insane two weeks and have barely slept as of late. I just worry that sometimes the student-CS15 TA dynamic may be too similar to that of a student-professor dynamic in that the TAs might internally disapprove of such inefficiency and bad planning, so I hope that the TAs won’t judge me for not being on top of things and scrambling to address various problems at this late time. This is mainly my fear and self consciousness talking, as I’d also just like to say that I’m forever grateful to all of them for being so patient, helpful, and responsive in hours or on Piazza, making the course fun, and creating amazing, easy to understand PowerPoints.

It wasn't something groundbreaking, but it made a huge difference for me - I got off campus. When I woke up today and looked out my window I could see how beautiful it was outside, but when I got out of bed and headed to class the beauty of the day was lost to me. I tried desperately to find it because I knew if I did it would make me happy, but it was nowhere to be found. After my class ended, I sought it elsewhere. I walked off campus, down the hill a bit to Prospect Park, and there it was. The cool air, the scattered leaves, the clear sky, all combined and it was as if a fog cleared from my eyes. I felt really happy for the first time in a long time. After a while I had to return to campus for more classes, and though nothing about the weather or the day changed, I could no longer see what I saw off-campus earlier. For some reason, the campus itself was muting it for me, and that was kind of revelatory. Yet for the rest of the day I carried that happiness in me and friends even noted the change. 
I find it really easy while on the hill to think that the world ends at the foot of the hill. The surrounding city and towns blur away, and the hill and its inhabitants feel like all there is. I think today made more clear to me that I have to challenge that regularly and make myself push that boundary, because beyond it is where I can be reminded about the rest of the world and the beauty and happiness in it. I think I will start trying to schedule off-hill time to help achieve that, whether that means going back to Prospect or India Point Park, walking/riding along the East Bay Bike Path, or even just sitting and doing work at the mall where I can be surrounded by people who look more like the rest of the world and less like the microcosm that is Brown. I think that will be very helpful for me, and I hope that it can be helpful for some of you as well. Don't give up, you deserve happiness and it is out there, even if you can't find it within the confines of this campus. And if anyone needs a friend to get off-campus with let me know, or just find me off the hill :)",

Please be conscious of your words because, at a diverse place like Brown, you never know who's around you who doesn't share the same privileges as you. Imagine a wealthy student talking about her yacht and beach house while sitting next to a low income student. When people around me talk about voting and selecting between candidates, I feel like that low income student. I wish I wasn't born in the country I was and had the privilege of democracy, but I don't. So all I ask is that my peers at Brown are more mindful of situations like these. Thanks!",

Where the STEM hipsters hang out
Where Faunce 2nd floor meets the Underground.
There's a space wide known to the suffering earthlings of Brown
That is an oasis within its grounds

Where the sofas are less funky
And the food less junky
Where the students are not as sad looking
And the coffee not as bad brewing (shout out to Christine)

Where stairs double as seats
Where it's actually enjoyable to study
Where you can see the light of day
and not rot in a (scili) basement wasting away

talk about education
talk about satisfaction
talk about agitation
talk about frustration
talk about aspirations

Revisiting the 2nd highest tower of the Sciences Quad during a Tour. November 10, 2018 

Five weeks have past; five weekends, with the length
Of five long Algos homeworks! and again I see
These sunsets, rolling from the mediocre sky-line of Providence
With a tender, brewing murmur. -Once again
Do I behold these soft but violent orange, pinkish glows,
That on a tame and cold scene impress
Thoughts of more confused introspection; and connect
The landscape of students clustering like ants
Around tables outside the Scili
With the stillness of the sky.
The day is come when I again repose
Here, next to this broken hammock, and view
These plots of college-ground, these intellectual-cuffs,
Which, at this senior season, with my unripe fruits of job-search,
Make me doubt why I am studying CS in the first place.",

2018-11-15T21:17Z,3067,,"Hi, so um, I've never... written a BBA like this. Usually just for friends or random people doing something beautiful (I guess that includes existing?)... but never like this. I'm also super nervous, not just because I'm afraid of what this person'll think, or because I don't want people to casually talk about my feelings in the comments, or just for fear of this coming off as cheesy or inconsequential or some other thing I should be afraid of. But because... well, I really like this person, and that makes me nervous. Nothing new on BBA, right? 
I guess I need to put this out there, for this person to know or at least to work through it on my own. Uhh, I haven't had this happen in all my time at Brown—which was a relief, believe me—but regardless, I really like this one person. Actually the sweetest person I've met in college, possibly ever. And ridiculously smart—and not just Brown smart, like actually boutta-f*ck-up-their-industry-and-maybe-the-world smart. Really funny too, the whole thing going on.
And I get that when you like someone, everything about them is beautiful, and maybe that's what's happening here, or maybe that's just who this person is. Independent of whether I like him, I'd like to think his smile is still so bright it's almost unacceptable, and the way he says """"sweet"""" after something goes right is just as endearing, and gosh, he's such a dork it makes me want to cry. Also his ears turn pink when he laughs, and he just has this whole 'good-natured' feel about him, and I can't help but think that he's so soft and that I want to hold his face. He's so nice to listen to, not just because his voice sounds nice, but also because he's so nerdy in a really comfortable way, and it's oddly soothing. He also has the most interesting face, and I always end up doodling that objectively good nose and and really strong widow's peak, but of course I can't do him any justice. It doesn't help that I have the feeling he gives really good hugs, and he'd be so nice to be held by...
There's so much more about him, but this is already longer than I told myself I'd allow it to be. He most definitely doesn't know who this is from, probably because I'm sure there are plenty of people weak for him, and also because he makes me too shy to have made an impression on him. So yeah, that's been my incredibly cowardly confession. Take it as it is, and I'll just... I'll just leave it at that.

Please forgive my language, but why do I care if she has a boyfriend? Like, I'll let her know how I feel and that I like her and want to get to know her, and if she rejects me that's cool. I don't mind that. But to not even try? What if she, or any other girl in this situation for that matter is the love of my life? Nothing against the other guy, but if she were to theoretically break up with him because of me, doesn't that mean they weren't meant to be in the first place?",

S/o to all the non-monogamous folks on campus - whether you’re partnered or not, you deserve love and respect!

As an ethically non-monogamous woman myself, I have really tried to keep my composure over your post. It’s a little humorous, this idea of being “too woke.” But I can tell you, for myself, my partners, and the precious few other non-mono folks I know on campus, that we don’t live this way to be “woke.” And I’m flat-out pissed that you would insinuate that.

I agree that it is icky when a guy says that he’s “woke” because of the fact that he’s in a non-mono relationship or is considering one. But if someone you admire to be woke for other reasons is questioning why monogamy is the dominant relationship structure in our society, maybe listen a moment before dismissing him? Mononormativity (like the post that you made) hurts. It says that I shouldn’t love my partners, or be happy for them finding love with other people, or seek out friendship with their partners or wish for a day when we can all live together. In some states, my love is a literal crime. 

Seeing all those people react positively to your sentiment validates your demonization of non-mono people and honestly makes me sad.

To be clear, I have no problem with people who practice monogamy, and when dating I try to be as transparent as possible about my non-monogamous status. I also don’t think a la Sex At Dawn that everyone should be non-monogamous — but it should be an option. Mononormative society only allows for people to be single, or monogamous, or cheat (aka, non-ethically non-monogamous). Creating space for non-monogamous options is difficult because it challenges the way we’ve been taught to think about love, sex, and power. And I want that choice for everyone.

Wokeness doesn't have any correlation to relationship structure, and treating non-monogamous folks as """"too woke"""" is distressingly dismissive. I hope you find someone to enjoy a monogamous relationship with and shares your values, but please don't treat people who structure their relationships differently from you as worse people for it.",

2018-11-17T00:58Z,3132,,"Eric Kim-
I see you all the time, but it’s always from a distance. We’ve never actually been introduced, but we’ve been face to face on numerous occasions, and I’d like to think on most subjects we see eye to eye, even though we’re so different. I work all night and you work all day, and everyday our paths cross, but I can’t change my schedule and I know you can’t change yours, so I guess we’ll just have to keep it that way. I know I am one of many, know there are countless others chasing after you, but I still can’t shake the feeling that our relationship is different; everyone likes to lump us together, our names and dominions go hand in hand, but in all honesty, we can never meet, not properly I mean. If we did, it might be like one of those things, where the universe implodes or something. Even though I’m small and cold and pale in comparison, I only shine because of you. Too bad we can’t meet up, I’ll have to love you from afar, but when it comes down to it, that’s the way it’s always been.
It’s right that you should be the center and leave all others to orbit in your wake.
You’re the only chinghoo for me",

I acknowledge that people flaunt about offers and what not (please don’t discuss your offers in public. Like, happy for you but I’m actually nauseated by people who say “of course I’m gonna take google but, (insert bullshit first world problem flaw)”. Like, shut the fuck up. Anyways, back to the positives. 

Sorry for the tangent. Don’t hate on the TAs. They work hard to see as many people as possible! And also, you can’t expect people to just be nice and collaborative. If they are, it’s a plus. The baseline is that they don’t fuck you over. And I haven’t heard of a case of anyone trying to fuck each other over yet. People know better than to do that. I think people in the CS department here uphold quite a high standard of moral & compassion.

Ok I’m done. And to sum up, this post is to admire the great people in CS",

2018-11-30T19:14Z,3541,,"As the semester closes out, i wanted to give a special shoutout to everyone for making it through (GO US!!! seriously incredible and no small feat) but especially to the first years. I'm a sophomore, and last year at this time I was tired, lonely, burnt out, riddled with impostor syndrome and kind of sad. I'd made a few friends here and there, but I didn't feel comfortable on this campus AT ALL. In any way shape or form. Dealing with first semester (and frankly, the entire first two years of college) can be A LOT. For some of you, it may have been your best 3 months ever! To those people, I offer my sincerest congratulations. I'm happy for you. But for the rest of you who don't feel comfortable at Brown yet, who feel lonely, or isolated, or academically strained, or like the expectations at Brown in every area of life have been too much to bear, I offer this: I am in such a better place now than I was a year ago. And it will get better for you too - please believe that. Sheer repetition on this campus makes for comfort. Finding your favorite study spot in the library. Molding a routine that works for you. Saying hi to the same people you pass in the street on the way to class. Learning all the street names and building names simply by passing them by. Will you ever feel 100% comfortable here? Maybe not. I don't, many days. But the thing that's different is that now I've learned that it's ok to feel out of place here! I felt so much pressure my first year to fit in, to look like I was having the best time of my life, to report to my nosy and caring relatives that I was abundantly happy. Now I know that it's ok to take stock of everything, good and bad, comfort and discomfort, happiness and sadness, friendship and loneliness, A's and B's and C's and NC's (lol brown) and to accept it all for what it is instead of fighting it. To acknowledge that it might cause me pain or unease, and that those feelings are valid and ok. And that everyone has them - even if they paint a picture of perfection in public. Perfection simply isn't true for any person on this campus. 

So to all the first years who feel like this semester was the hardest 3 month span of your life - I can absolutely, 100% guarantee you that you are FAR from alone. Even though everyone else wants to make you feel like you're the only one struggling. You will come to realize you are not. I also want to incorporate a SPECIAL shoutout to my FLi first years - you guys have accomplished a miracle, truly, and should be bursting with pride, however this semester ends for you. I admire all of you so. damn. much. 

While I do know some of you personally (y'all are awesome), I don't know most of you.... but in both cases, I'm extremely proud of all of you for getting through your first semester in one of the most academically and socially and extracurricularly stringent environments in the country. You guys DID! THAT! And the beautiful thing about college is that every single semester is a completely blank slate, full of glorious potential for the things to come, things you can't even fathom.",

2018-12-07T21:32Z,3793,,"I see a lot of posts about feeling alone, feeling like you don't have friends, and being unsure of how to make friends on campus.
When I first came to Brown I didn't feel like I really had a friend group until later in spring semester - before then, I felt like I couldn't connect to anyone. It seemed like everyone else had a solid friend group who they had so much fun with, and I started to think maybe it was because I wasn't interesting or because there were too many differences between me and other kids here. I considered transferring, too.
But it got better! I made one close friend, who introduced me to their friends, and through them I kept meeting new people. It's a lot easier to make new friends if you have someone to introduce you - and it's way more likely that you'll like the new people you'll meet too. 
It's easier said than done to go, """"just meet that one friend, through them you'll meet lots of other people"""", but that's how it worked for me! If you meet someone who you think has a similar sense of humor to you, has similar interests, just reach out! Don't worry about looking desperate. You just gotta keep faking that confidence until you make it.",

Now is a great time to start offering your extra un-finishable swipes to folks who might be struggling to get meals during a difficult time! 

Sound too inconvenient maybe? Too much work? No worries, just offer your location (ex. Sci-li for the afternoon) and it's totally okay for you to have students meet you where you are for your card and then come back to return it! Thank you so much for your help.

2018-12-09T06:37Z,3876,,"An ode to dumpling:

The humble dumpling has two essential components: the filling and the encasing. Without either of these, the dumpling is no longer a dumpling but rather, much like myself, a massive disappointment. Those of us who have been consoled by the hopes that it is not what's on the outside that matters will be sadly disappointed to hear that the outside is the most important dumpling determiner. However fear not! Dumplings have shown mankind that it is possible to be soft, doughy, AND beautiful. In that vein, the outside of the dumpling must be starchy and dough-based and be formed of one (or at most two joined) pieces that can be wrapped or folded around the filling (dipping the filling into a batter and frying is not a dumpling that's just fried food which is also great but again, not. a. dumpling.). The filling, which we shall address in a moment, shall be almost completely encased by the wrapping. In this field, I am somewhat of a pioneer for my allowance of a small gap or hole. However, holes can be valuable as without one on your face you could never consume the delicious delicacy that is the dumpling. Nonetheless, we must be careful to limit this gap to a certain size. For example, a pita pocket is no longer a dumpling due to the large opening required to add the stuffing. The final criteria for the encasing is that it should be, in a sense, solid and able to hold its form under some duress. As a counterexample, let us examine a burrito. Although upon initial inspection we have a dumpling-like object, the fact of the matter is that a wrapped outside that has not been set by some form of cooking, such as steaming or boiling, can be easily unwrapped. In the instance where the casing and the filling can be separated with such ease, we have an entity that is, sadly, not a dumpling. 
At last we come to the filling of the dumpling. Some consider this a rather avant-garde approach, but I posit that the only thing that really matters is that a filling exists and is edible. These minimal criteria may, of course, lead to some very poor dumplings, but these are dumplings nonetheless. A dumpling exterior without a filling is only an empty shell of a dumpling and a social pariah of the dumpling world. But it is the happy union of an excellent filling and a dough-based exterior that forms a superior dumpling. And so we have the mighty dumpling.

I know there were moments of frustration where you just wanted to yell/cry/give up because something wasn't working, but that's part of the reason I loved TA-ing this course - because in those moments I got the chance to watch you help each other, keep pushing, and ultimately figure out that you're all 100% capable. I hope you feel like you've learned something in the class, and I know many of you would make great TAs for next year's future students. I promise it will be one of the best things you do during your time at Brown.

Yours truly... TA",

i was making my way to andrews one afternoon, and i noticed a couple standing near the pembroke seal. they were arguing--not sure about what---but they both appeared rather flustered. as i approached, i witnessed the unthinkable: the girl began stomping on the pembroke seal furiously, repeatedly, shouting something along the lines of, """"you're stuck with me now!"""", while her dude looked on, incredulous and--frankly--looking a bit petrified. it was one of the most savage things i have witnessed on this campus.

The way your eyes light up when you’re excited
Your positive vibrations illuminating the space and people around you

Lucky to have befriended you
Lucky to have loved you
Unlucky for you not to feel the same
Lucky to have deep feelings in the first place though
Better than the emptiness I usually feel.

Hope you find your place in life
Your passion, your drive
Recognize your ambitions 
Take risks and live life to the fullest
You deserve it.",

Here’s some appreciation for people in recovery/battling an eating disorder. It’s so draining and difficult to cope with an eating disorder much less be a student while doing it; it’s like a full time job on top of school, and it can be so discouraging and pervasive to try to manage everything/pursue recovery while doing school. On top of it all, eating disorders and eating disorder culture are really not discussed AT ALL at Brown and it can be so isolating and difficult to find resources and support systems that are consistent or helpful. 

So to all those struggling with eating disorders, you are seen, you are valuable, you are enough, you are not alone, and no matter where you are with ED right now, you’re experience is valid and you are managing an incredibly difficult thing and I’m proud of you for it. Just know that there is someone out there who is rooting for you and who believes in you and who thinks that you are amazing and resilient",

2019-01-10T00:45Z,4500,,"2019 PSA/Resolution!:

In 2019, we’re shooting our shots with everyone we really want to be friends with or are crushing on. Do you have someone that you’ve been idly thinking for months that you’d like to get to know better? Do you have a major super-crush on a super kool kat? Have you been posting BBA posts telling someone to make a move or asking if someone would be down for a date but then never following up? Well that’s bad! Don’t do that!

Increasingly as I’ve reflected on why I haven’t asked out people I’m into -- either as potential friends or ~love interests~ -- I’ve come up blank. The truth is, if you ask someone out for coffee, __as long as you’re not creepy or weird about it, it’s not really that scary of an experience__. Here are some tippers!

A: Personally, when you’re first getting to know someone you might be _into_, I think it’s a _lot_ better to just ask them out for coffee and have it be a bit ambiguous if it’s a date-date or just a friend-date. If you explicitly label it as a date-date when you ask someone out, there’s a strong chance it will come off weirdly if you don’t know them very well, and there’s now a lot more pressure and expectations in the mix. People don’t want to go on a second “date” unless the first one goes really well, and if it doesn’t go really well, people tend to feel more awkward about it.

On the flip side, it’s a lot less weird to ask someone you don’t know that well out to coffee than it is to ask them to go on a _date_ with you. And in this case, you can still end up both having a great time and ending up ~into~ one another, but even if you don’t, you’re probably a bit closer now and would be willing to do it again some time as long as it doesn’t go super badly. And in the end, regardless of how they view it in their own head, good healthy relationships require you to get to know someone and be their friend, and good relationships can often take a long time to form or get started.

Feel free to disregard if you’re reasonably confident that both of you are ~into~ one another.

B: People like meeting new people! We all want friends! Most of us want to find love or companionship! As long as you’re not weird or creepy about it, if you ask someone out for coffee, they’ll probably be pretty excited or flattered that you think they’re ~kool~ enough that you felt the desire to reach out to them! Unless you give someone a reason to not like you or feel comfortable grabbing coffee with you, you really probably don’t have much to worry about.

C: Even if someone does say no, rejection isn’t really that scary. Honestly, what’s the big deal? Unless you make a big deal out of it and act weirdly around them for the rest of your life, no one really cares. Some of my current friends are people I had crushes on and told them, only for them to tell me they didn’t reciprocate. Some of my friends are people that told me they had crushes on me, only for me to tell them I didn’t feel the same way. It’s part of life. It’s not really weird unless you decide to make it weird!

With that all said, even if you know you should shoot your shot, it can be a bit hard to know what that looks like. Should you walk up to someone and ask them point blank? What exactly should you say? My personal opinion is that in most situations, hitting someone up on Messenger is usually the way to go, and you can just say something like

To someone you barely know (provide some motivation to how you know who they are):
“Hey, I know this is kinda like out of the blue, but I’ve [seen you around] (replace this with how you know of them if you know them through taking a class or something) and you seem really cool. Would you maybe be down to grab coffee sometime?”

To someone you know a little bit better:
“Hey, I know this is kind of out of the blue, but you seem really cool and I was wondering if you maybe would be down to grab coffee sometime?”

To someone you kind of consider a friend:
“Hey, do you want to maybe grab coffee sometime?”

If all of those are too awkward for you and you need to provide a little extra motivation, feel free to hit em with a
“Hey, I made a New Year’s resolution to try to reach out to people I’d like to get to know a little better. Would you maybe be down to grab coffee sometime?”
or a more general
“Hey, I’ve been trying hard lately to reach out to people that I’d like to get to know a bit better. Would you maybe be down to grab coffee sometime?”

If you have any critiques of these, or have better less awk feeling/more natural ways to say any of this, post in the comments below, although these ones have worked okay for me!

In the end though, I know a lot of people who are p lonely, and pretty much everyone I know wants to know a few extra people or to get ~close~ with someone, so I’mma make 2019 the year I shoot my shots, and I’m encouraging everyone else to too! (And I know this is an anonymous post, but please shoot your shots at me too!) Thnks, bye!

Running for CCB last year was the best decision I ever made. I was a first-year and still trying to figure out what I wanted to get involved in at Brown. As a very anxious person, I didn't think I had what it took to run and win, but deciding to run changed my life. CCB is such a positive force in my life. Not only does my own class' board love and support me, the entirety of CCB has made me feel so welcome and validated. I've had incredible mentors and without them, I probably would not love being at Brown as much as I do. While I tell you all this at GB all of the time, I truly truly love you all so mcuh. CCB is like a family to me! Thank you for always empowering and supporting me. Again, I love you all so much ♥",

Stolen goddess from Greece's sand,
With Saturday's sweet shots consumed,
Borne back to Providence's land.
O, the victims she has wooed.
Atop the crude Emery floors,
Doth rest the angel that I've dreamed;
Alight my soul like Norway's fjords,
And ne'er her gold complexion dimm'd.
Of figures, stats her head obsessed,
With silky curves my eyes have met,
Untamed by British interest,
A caryatid in stone was set.
Her Grecian smile my loins doth stir,
With certainty, I would fuck her.",

I've been reading a lot about the strength of practicing in routines helping people reach their goals, so I have been trying super hard lately to hold myself accountable and work on the things that are meaningful to me. This, of course, has had some stumblings, but I try. And it's tough because it's my own, solo effort. 

Anyway, backstory aside, the past few days as I've been walking down Thayer at 9 a.m. I've heard this beautiful violin music coming out of somewhere in Hegeman. I just wanted to shout out to you, violin player, diligently practicing in your own routine-- thanks for reminding me that, even if other people are working towards different goals than I am, we're all kind of in these routines together, striving to be better people who are better at the things we love to do. I know your practicing has nothing to do with me or my own writing practice, but I feel a sense of kinship with you, and wanted to say thanks.",

Imagine living in a country halfway across the Earth from home, and you're doggedly studying for three exams so you just wanna microwave some comfort food, mac & cheese. Then as you take out excitedly you realize everyone around you thinks it looks like diarrhea and smells pungent, so you hide and gobble it hurriedly while your roommate's not home in the corner of your solitude. 

If we wanted to, we could say the same about common white food. Honestly, Chobani SMELLS. But I won't say anything when you open one in the library. I just miss home. And I wish I was less ashamed of the steamy, amazing food that brings me back to it but I am.",

I've been told I'm attractive but I have a weirdly shaped face that gets me marked as unconventional looking. Furthermore I'm not stick skinny in a university in which everyone seems to be naturally thin or just needs to try a little harder to get to where their body is - which sucks as a girl.

I feel so alone and mediocre in everything - I try so hard to smile wide and not incriminate myself with the ultimate marker of insecurity - feeling sorry myself- but it sucks knowing I'll never be as pretty or smart or athletic or thin or sociable as other girls.",

2019-02-23T18:49Z,6161,,"@6145 as a straight girl, I like being approached by guys. I think you have to do it in a way that isn't incredibly sexualized and that gives her space to leave. Like if you approach her and she seems uncomfortable you can ask respectfully if she wants you to leave (making it clear that you are totally okay with that) or just give her an out/leave yourself. Don't instigate a conversation based around her body, but compliments, including about her style choices are okay (hair color, dress, etc) so long as they aren't sexualized. If you can find a commonality or obvious talking point, that's best though. Not holding her up is ideal because you dont want her to feel trapped, so if things seem to be going well you can offer to give her your number. Don't ask for hers, because that can be super uncomfortable as a woman, but giving her yours gives her the autonomy and choice. Overall, treat her like a person, do not be overbearing and try to be cognizant of your privilege and her body language and you'll be okay",

Your touch makes me pull apart the walls I’ve so carefully built to survive this disastrous campus, your hugs make me want to melt into your embrace. Your carefully, well out thoughts and attentive listening encourages me to talk on and on, and ensures me I’m never boring you. Your chuckle makes me blush - and laugh countlessly. When you lay next to me, I can’t help but put my head on top of your chest, because feeling your heart beat slow, and steady, makes mine drop to match it.

The first few years, I felt dumb in most of my classes. The times I had sections or had group study sessions, everyone else seemed to be so much more ahead of me. I convinced myself it was because they were either geniuses or they had perfect study schedules that my procrastinating ass couldn't keep up with. But the truth is, the geniuses probably just have background knowledge from other classes that make it easier for them to grasp. And the students with perfect study schedules just learn differently than me. 

All I'm saying is, I started to learn better again when I focused on me. When I focused on how I study best and that's it. Never feel you're dumb here or anywhere. If you screw up one test, you can do better on the other. It can get better, I swear.",

This is an S.O.S.
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line
It's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two (Brian has half)
And I can't find the other half (it's with Brian)
It's like I'm walking on broken glass (ouch)
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get... (sad)

Also,
I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
And also Brian Mundelius and I were married (cute)

I've been dancin' on top of cars
And stumblin' out of bars
I follow you (Brian) through the dark
Can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain (ow)
The tattoo inside my brain (fun fact! Brain is an anagram of Brian)
And baby, you know it's obvious

I'm a sucker for you
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly (my EYES)
I'm a sucker for you, ooh yeah
Any road you take you know that you'll find me

I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (About you)
About you (About Brian)
And you're making the typical me
Break my typical rules (naughty)
It's true, I'm a sucker for you @ YOU BRIAN, I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU BRIAN MUNDELIUS

This post is about Brian.",

Okay so about a year ago I was hooking up with someone and she asked me what I liked (during sex) and I was FLOORED because nobody had ever asked me that before! I told her that she was the first person to ever ask me that question and she’s all like “wow what sorts of terrible people have you dated?” At the time I was like “yeah, every single other person has been a total piece of shit!” BUT THAT’S NOT TRUE. Since then, I’ve asked every person I’ve hooked up what they liked and (like me) they’ve all been super surprised by the question! Like, really honestly surprised! Which is kind of sad, you know? Lots of people haven’t had an answer right away (because, you know, we’re all still trying to figure all of this shit out) but we always make some progress and talk about it which is always awkward but kind of nice? Talking about sex is SO stigmatized and there’s all of this pressure to be good at it ALL THE TIME and I feel like it’s so easy to dismiss the fact that there’s a learning process attached to the whole thing. 

Ask people what they like! If they don’t know, try some stuff and check in to see what feels good! Not everyone likes the same kinky stuff and people’s interests change so check in regularly! I’m sure there are groups on campus that talk about this stuff so imma try to seek them out and it’d be cool if other people went too! All the admiration in the world for the girl who first asked me what I was into-and for everyone else who’s checking in with their partners and working to make these conversations become commonplace.

A few days ago, I was standing in line when a guy I've had a crush on since taking a class together freshman year joined the line behind me with a friend. Cue blushing, pretending to be busy with something else so he wouldn't see. And in the minutes he stood behind me, the image I had of him as smart and put together and compassionate disintegrated as I overheard him being crude and flippant with his friend.

Since then, as I've walked around campus and seen other long-time crushes, I've realized that I don't really know them. Today I saw a woman from debate that I've thought is breathtakingly beautiful for so long and realized she has a whole life that exists very well without me. I trust that there are tons of wonderful people here at Brown (there are!), but the expected last hurrah of pursing the people you haven't mustered the courage to ask out yet is no longer as appealing (and I have hooked up and dated and asked folks out and been rejected in my time at Brown).

And if I were to ask you of your current relationship status, how would you respond? Single? Ready to mingle? Your waving hair follows the pattern of the lilacs in the windy meadow. Your eyes possess an incendiary glow from the beaming light that shines on all, but most truly on you. I imagine that if one were to look closely, with passionate intent, they would see an iridescence so unknowing it would move them to a loving stage. Katherine Beggs, I cannot tell you much of myself, but I can say with utmost sincerity and truth: that you are a like a nymph. Certainly you have the voice of a nymph, but your aura is like that of a nymph: majestic and transcendent. So I ask you this: are you single? Single for someone like me?",

For all intents and purposes, I don’t think I know you enough, that I’m close enough to you to classify this feeling that way. It’s not jealousy I feel seeing you getting along with others, but jealousy-adjacent? I want to talk to you, to get to know you, to spend time with you, too. Does that have to be romantic? Is it just a deeper friendship that I’m looking for? It feels like more than that. What do I call this? How do I tell you what’s on my mind when I barely know myself?

English Teatime is blue,
you like tea
and I like you

deb marini
with hair so brown
around you I could never frown

my life, my love, 
my joy, my heart
my sweet summer child,
I was yours from the start

it warms my heart to see you thrive
if you weren't on my island
I don't think I'd survive

for you I'd do anything-- I'll contract the flu!
I'll go to the ratty! I'll take off my shoe!
I propose a metaphor of my love for you, deb:
if I was a bug, I'd be caught in your web

through thick and through thin,
I hope you'll be mine,
because really and truly, you are divine

is there a frog in my mouth?
or a big butterfly?
you're my favorite delawarean,
and the apple of my eye

ok, we lied
we're more than just one
which just means our love,
is double the fun

we love all your bits,
we love every joke,
if love was a currency
our last name would be Koch

like Eminem, Bowie, and Nico combined
as far as friends go, you're one of a kind
we're thankful for all the time we've spent together
Deb, whenever you're cold,
we will lend you a sweater",

It’s kind of ironic: when I am near you, there are moments when I am so nervous that I forget to breathe, and I can’t help but tense up. But when I am under stress, that very memory of your closeness relaxes me, and when I remember your head lightly touching mine, and how I felt the muscles in your face move as you smiled against my shoulder, I can breathe again—I let out every breath I ever held back all at once.",

Waiting to lure children into its
Pleasant trap
Of deliciousness.

Then into your mouth
Where they halt the growling of your stomach.
A perfect picking
To fill your hunger.
Succulent morsels of a feathered creature.

Who are you?
Face so cute,
Eyes so blue.
To keep calm is
All I can do,
When you pour
My daily brew. 

I wish I had
Your name, so I 
Could stop calling you
Tealuxe Guy. 
I would buy 
A Pumpkin Chai,
If it would make you
Just say hi. 

Ceylon, Sencha,
And Darjeeling,
I don’t know how
To stop this feeling. 
Tealuxe Guy,
My heart you’re stealing,
As I dance somewhere
Near the ceiling.

Tealuxe Guy,
I’m quite frustrated
Forever strangers
We must be fated. 
My thirst, therefore,
Cannot be sated,
But at least
I’m caffeinated.",

Camp RYSE, formerly known as BRYTE Summer Camp, is a five-week academic enrichment program for refugee youth in Providence (K-12). Our mission is to foster community, confidence, and joy among refugee youth through creative, inquiry-based learning and leadership development. Our community is built on asset-based, joyful learning; community participation and family engagement; youth leadership; and a deep commitment to creating a space for students can celebrate their identities and build friendships across common experiences of migration, resettlement, and adjustment to a new environment. 

This summer, Camp RYSE is looking to continue supporting and enrolling over 100 refugee Providence youth, while hosting our program in an accessible and air-conditioned space and expanding compensated leadership opportunities for our youth. We fundraise 100% of our budget, and would very much appreciate support (through advertising, donations, etc.) in order for Camp RYSE to be safe and successful for campers.

This community is built on doing what we can, when we can. We are forever grateful for the many ways each of you contribute. You can click here to share or donate -- you can also click here to view information about our ongoing snack drive. Thank you so much for your support.

he Fell in love with someone new
Each time I think I'm Over him
I realize I love him even more than vim (https://www.vim.org/ and that's a lot)
She is yoUng and sweet and different than I
But does she know your favoRite Pie?

Why am I hurTing so much more than you
I still have the gift yoU bought mE from the zoo
It's pathEtic to long for something long lost
But all my transGressioNs came at such a high cost
My very first love you will always be
I am sad there is no longer a you+me

The pain oF how quickly you were able to move on
will not so sOon be gone
My heaRt is yours and yours alone
I am sad and always waiting by the phone
Hoping you will call and ask for mE back

If we tried, we would have been great
Why oh why did we accept this cruel fate?
We pictured our life together, our wholesome future
Your life now deVoted to the art of the suture
I want to be the one to leave the light on for you whEn you get home
But now all I can give you is this stupid poem

In a few short months we may Reunite
But seeing you with someone else for me will surely be a plight
Did you ever truly love me at all?
Who else can you call
The keeper of our dogs
the dictator of our snogs
Your little fish who loves to dance
The one enchanted by your romance

Soon, oh soon, you will graduate
And I will always wish I could have one more date
This is getting so long
But I have been living my biggest fear
And it's all because I've lost you, my dear

p.s. if you got through all of that, thank you. I still love you all these months later. I am sad and lost and so alone without you. I have become a person I never thought I would be. Maybe now you give me another shot. What I would give for one last duet.",

2019-05-26T01:53Z,10605,,"Hey everyone,

There was a policy change announced in Today@Brown last night about sophomores being required to stay on meal plan.

We think that its grossly unfair to not let us have the choice or even the option to apply to be allowed off meal plan and we plan on voicing our concerns to the Office of the Dean of the College via an open letter of concern and a list of names in support. 

If anyone else is upset with the new policy and would like a change, please add your name to the google sheets and take a look at the google docs! We welcome any new ideas or changes!

We admire our right to not being broke and have food at the same time.

Here's a Google docs with the letter of concern:

Is there someone in the Class of 2020 who you've had crush on for a while, but haven't had the guts to ask out? Maybe someone from your freshman year unit or an FYS way back when? Or maybe someone you've just met recently and you've been seeing around the GCB? Well, now's your chance! Get ready for Round 1 of Brown Senior Scramble for the Class of 2020!!!! Just in time for *spooky season*.

Our team is currently planning on holding 3 more rounds throughout the school year: one towards the end of this semester, one around Valentine's Day, and one right before senior week.

It goes like this: you submit up to five names to our form. If someone who you listed also submits your name when they fill out our form, it's a match!!

Rules:
- Only members of the Class of 2020 or Class of 2020.5 can participate
- Up to 5 names can be submitted by Wednesday, October 30 at 11:59pm
- Matches will be privately emailed to both parties on Thursday, October 31
- A match DOES NOT imply any degree of sexual consent. Be respectful of your matches and seek consent just as you would in any other relationship.

Fill out the form at https://tinyurl.com/brownscramble2020-1

The turnaround is quick for this one, and the more people that fill out the form, the more likely people are to get matched!

Be sure to like our official Facebook page at https://facebook.com/brownscramble2020/ to get the most up-to-date information.

Ready, set, scramble!!",2019-10-24T16:05Z

I was the boy wearing the pizza costume, and I think that says it all. It was love at first sight. The green foliage you wore on your head was what first attracted my attention. From there, it only got better. It’s been four days, and I still can’t stop thinking about you. I would say please notice me, but I know you noticed me looking before you glanced away quickly. Too quickly… and still, your brown eyes haunt my every dream. And whenever I do get to see them again, it really piques my pepperoni… if you know what I mean.

We have mutual friends, but I don’t think we’ve ever hung out. I know you called me crusty, and told your friends you’re not interested… but I just wish you’d give me a chance. Every time I see you with another girl or guy, I die a little bit on the inside. My sun rises and sets with you. You’re the single most beautiful person/pineapple I’ve ever seen. All I’m asking for is a chance.

Yours forever (or at least as long as you’ll have me),

My love for you I once proclaim’d
In Hopes to touch thine gentle ears;
Who thought thy beauty could be tamed?
My loneliness I drown in beers.
With certainty I see you less
Thine scarcity my days doth cloud.
Alas, I fear, one must confess
For e’en in love not all’s allowed.
He who purloins my fairest rhymes
Accustomed to your marble glow,
Forbidden fruit of careless crimes,
A drunken night he stole my flow.
Dear imposter, no skill is free,
For now: I bite my thumb at thee.",

And yet this feeling persists
It lives in me 

I drove by your house once
Just to be close to you

My hand wonders aloud
Where yours has gone
It feels less protected
Without your interwoven fingers

I fantasize about seeing your name 
Pop up on my phone
Hey, you’d say
I made a mistake, you’d say
Can we talk?

I know it won’t happen
Every minute I spend daydreaming of 
Our reconciliation 
Or writing about it
Is another week I’ll spend
unable to move on

And I must 
It is something I must do
Move on
Because it seems as though
You already have
And now it’s just me
Mourning us
Alone

So I will mourn
And write more poems
As many as it takes
And the last leaves will fall off the trees
And one day 
It’ll all just be a memory 
I’ll forget your hands and your laugh
You’ll forget my eyes and the way they saw you
And that’s all",

Fight back, even if you’ve been fighting for a long time, seemingly without end, even if it feels like you can’t keep fighting. You can and will survive. You will thrive, even if it seems like that is infinitely far away, even if it takes a long time to get there. You are stronger than you know.",

Please know that many someones have felt admiration for you—for your spirit, your enthusiasm when you get into the topic you love, that brilliant observation you made, for the way that you look, flush-faced and breathless as you walk into a room on a windswept day, for that feature of yours that you've always felt self conscious about, but to them, is perfectly charming. Also know that so often, these thoughts go unspoken, silenced by fear of embarrassment, fear of causing discomfort, by the moment passing, by the fact that we've all trained ourselves to let these admirations pass by. Know that just because the appreciation people feel for you is silent, does not mean that it is nonexistent.

For all you who are reading, I challenge you: let's be each other's admirers. Embrace the pleasant discomfort. Don't let all the random, mundane appreciations you feel slip away unvoiced, but share one here and there. Let's normalize a culture where showing appreciation and admiration doesn't have to be confined to an anonymous page or limited to occasions of remarkable achievement or generosity, but can be shared day-to-day, face-to-face, accompanied by a perhaps unfamiliar, but no less warm smile.",

Brown happened because I can't make myself trust or like a single ""friend"" I made here, though I pretend my best to make them feel they're my favorite people ever. I feel vulnerable here, like a chick on the ground after falling from its nest that can be crushed under an unknowing heel at any moment. I don't know how people survive in this environment. I've been away from family enough to get used to home not being home, but the more the years that accumulate in me without home I feel myself breaking. Maybe I just want the attention, just for one person to notice I'm not the bubbly, hyper, happy-go-lucky girl I portray everyday. I don't want to die. I just want this kind of life to end. And a life without Brown is a broken pause button, no better than death. I say I wanna be fixed but do I There are no wants inmy life. There are only needs.

I miss you
It’s been a week since I’ve been happy 
I walk a lot of laps 
But nothing else slaps
The way that you hit me

Goldfish in the Ratty
I wrote this ballad because
I need you in my salad
Or even as a side

Some people resort to cereal
But you are so ethereal
I miss you every day that your gone
And that’s why I wrote this song

It’s been a week
And I’m feeling weak
Without you in my life

Goldfish in the Ratty
I miss the way you smile back at me

In my heart there is a hole
Because I miss the way you fill my cereal bowl 
I feel defeated 
Because no other snack has ever competed
With my love for you

Oh yes goldfish
I miss you much more than this
Song could ever describe
Come back into my life",

To others, it’s to answer that age old question of do I have free will? And to many, it’s how do I make big bucks and do good in the world simultaneously? But for me it’s something else. To me it’s to ask two questions central to how the world works. (1) is Maia Chiu single. And (2) how does one get to know her?? 👀 for reals tho",

2020-03-03T21:48Z,14837,,"- the space in between -
There's so much that I cannot say
So much that I cannot bring myself to put into words
To put into air
To put into the world
When after they have been set free then they cannot be caught back and hidden away again
Before they cross the space in between us.
But if I could
Set down lyrics to these thoughts and snippets
I would write the colors of your summer dresses
Sing the arc of your lashes and the waves of your hair
Somehow describe all that you mean to me.
But my words aren't enough.
I can't capture the echoes of your voice in my heart long after it's faded from my ears
Or the way I remember any of the other moments
That likely never meant so much to you.
Still
If I were to make an attempt,
Put words on paper and try to sift my fears and doubts from the space in between
I think that all that would remain is
I love you.

2020-03-13T12:07Z,15112,,"SENIOR SCRAMBLE ROUND 3 - """"UNDERGRAD OMELETTE""""

Hi everyone, due to the possibility that Brown students might be going home at some point later in the semester, the senior scramble team has decided to hold an additional round of senior scramble! If classes are cancelled, this will be our final round of senior scramble. If they are not cancelled, then we'll still have the additional round right before senior week.

There is one TWIST with this round: we've gotten countless requests to have a round of senior scramble that allows seniors to match with students who are not seniors, and other requests for underclassmen to be included in the pool for the matching process. Thus, we've decided to call Round 3 of Senior Scramble the """"Undergrad Omelette"""", where all undergrad students can participate.

Rules:
- All undergrad Brown students can participate, and can put down the name of a Brown student in any class year
- Up to 5 names can be submitted by Saturday, March 14 at 11:59pm
- Matches will be privately emailed to both parties on Sunday, March 15
- A match DOES NOT imply any degree of sexual consent. Be respectful of your matches and seek consent just as you would in any other relationship.
- Any questions should be emailed to brownscramble2020@gmail.com

Fill out the form at https://tinyurl.com/brownscramble2020-3

You are silly and sweet, and you've brought so much laughter into my life. 

I am so immensely sorry that your senior competition season got cut short. You shine so bright out there on the floor, and it'd be great to see you get out there a few more times. But just know that you definitely made an impact in your time on the gymnastics team. You've inspired me to better myself and really embrace my passions.

I’ve spent my spring break thus far reaping the land for materials to build us not just a house that is safe, but a home that brings comfort. I can’t promise you much, for I am but a simple minecrafter, but I could provide you with as much bread and cobblestone as your heart desires. I’ve even been saving up my resources and going without much needed tools just so one day I could give you a horse with diamond armor, maybe as an anniversary present? 😉
I know this is a lot to ask, and it’s probably happening pretty quickly, so I don’t want to rush you, I’ve built an annex tower to my Minecraft lodge where you can put your bed and set your spawn until you’re ready to move in completely (which I hope would be soon 🥺).

These two were the absolute highlights of their last concert I went to with like 20 people in it, and they get along so well together.

After the summer, I'll (hopefully) be gone from Providence. For good. In all likelihood we'll never cross paths ever again.

Strangely, I'm happy for you. You implicitly told me to f off. That's the first time I see you stand up for yourself. Although, I wish you had the strength to tell me explicitly, and tell me why.

I consider myself beyond lucky to call her a friend and to say that we are close.
Beyond that, Lizzy has a beautiful smile that always illuminates my day which accompanies a sincere kindness and generosity which one can only admire and respect. I do not know if she will see this nor if you will post this, yet I hope it does find a way to her - more than anything to let her know that someone appreciates her for who she is.",

You are an amazing leader, songwriter, thinker, and mathematician, and I am so glad that you are going to teach next year, because I wish I had more teachers like you when I was in middle school. You create kind and fun communities and make everyone in them happier because you are around. 
Here’s the short and the long of it:
Just about everyone in math DUG wants to be you, be with you, or both. Last week you had minimum 3 people jealous of a pilot in Hawaii’s middle school years, and everyone else was terribly jealous of you. How many math concentrators actually had a life in middle school?
You have this wonderful way of going through the world, brightening every room you enter, and I hope that after you graduate I can still occasionally be in them.",

Which can explain the superb shape he’s in,
But I spend my time worried he’ll go splat.
He likes his tea like his white shirts and shoes
In quantity but not variety
But I hear he does great in 22
And understands all sets that start with p.

When I see you in passing, I can barely muster a smile and an exhausted ""How've you been?"" and listen intently as you tell me about classes or meetings, when really I want to know how you've been, without our friendship. Without us cuddling to sleep or watching dumb TV or eating spicy food until we set our mouths on fire. How have you been, really, because I haven't been, at all. You only exist in our pictures, our old texts, our memories now. I wish things were different, just with you, God, I wish. But they aren't, they probably never will be, so I'll just wish you the best and hope to God you're happy forever and then some. I hope you've been well. I love you.",

I remember times I see a beloved one passing by and talk with them for 20 minutes and show up late for my class. I remember the happiness and livelihood in my heart when I am being called across thayer. I remember the excitement when everyone is talking about that fish dish at the ratty or the special new dessert. I remember the long lines for the omlette and how I would rather stay hungry than to wait. I remember Gail's warm smile when she swipes my card. I remember the nice kids at Brown who will help you without knowing who you are. I remember my stressful times and all the people who helped me. I remember the empathy my professors showed towards me. I remember the basement of the sci li and I wish to forget that. I remember the sunlab and how it stings. I remember the chem labs and how useless they are. I remember I hated that life. I remember it was boring. I remember I was miserable. I wish I remembered to pause and appreciate its beauty. I wish to remember the nice things in my life. I wish I continue to remember my gratitude to these days. I wish to remember to live the beauty in my everyday. I wish to get back to that life.,

Thank you for always being here for us and really meaning it. Even though we continually roast you, you still extend your love to us. You’re the kindest person I’ve ever met, and all of our adventures have been filled with joy and lots of laughter. Truly the 宝贝 to all of us. Thank you for pushing me to try new things and for always being there to comfort me when I'm down!!! Jasmine cool.

And two little Oreos
And a dental drill

And a little dentist's house
And a yellow-toothed mouse
And a viola and a bow
With some sheet music in tow
And a quiet lady playing Mah-Jong

2020-06-08T22:49Z,16762,,"You better read this because this is the most honest I’ll ever be able to be with you, and there’s a reason I chose today of all days to do this. And you’re probably laughing that I’m writing this here of all places. 
Used to love you and used to think you understand me, but now when you do things without realising or even thinking about how they make me feel I realise how wrong I was all along. I understand why you do what you do, and I’m never going to ask you to change anything for me because that’s not my place anymore. But this makes it so hard for me to move past what happened and see you the way I used to. I still love you though, although not in the same way as before. It’s the kind of way where hearing about you doing something good or getting something you wanted makes me feel warm and glow up for you inside. The kind of way in which if you’re doing something that might get you hurt I’ll worry about you. But I won’t ever tell you that, because I’m scared of trusting you with anything I feel. I want you to be happy in every possible way, even about the thing that sometimes makes me sting with bitterness. I want to trust you again and see your face and hear your voice and watch your name light up my screen and not feel my heart sink and my body tense up because I’m suddenly (even if momentarily) reminded of how it felt to sit numbly as you chose to not choose me a little more everyday, and blamed myself for it. 
But I care about you, and think about you, and often when something exciting happens whether it’s a new person I’m flirting with or a new thing my dog does or a fight I have with my family you’re the first person I want to talk to. But I can’t, because it hurts, and I would rather love you from afar than hate you all the time. 
If you’re wondering what this is about or if it’s about you, this probably doesn’t concern you.",

I can read a book on theory in this game like it’s the vampire saga that my sister loved as a teen. Each class this year, I played nonstop. Took 0 notes. Grades weren’t amazing but it’s ok bc I fucking rock at this game. My best friend now knows whether I’m playing or not bc he figured out what my finger movement on the mousepad when playing this game looks like while watching lecture capture every day.

He is so funny and handsome and levelheaded and even though he doesn’t like it when I tell him he’s smart, he is just unbelievably gifted. It can be hard to believe how much easier he finds his work than anyone I’ve ever met and how hard he works anyway. He could skate by on his insane abilities but he never has, and I don’t think he ever will. 
The thing I admire most about him is the care that he gives me. He is always there for me when I need him (which is a lot) and his advice is perfect, even when I don’t want to hear it. He remembers every detail from every story I tell, and he watches comedies with me because he knows I can’t handle scary movies during Covid. He talks to me every day.

I mean I think we all have imposter syndrome sometimes, but this level of Herculean deduction must be divine in nature, because no mere mortal could figure such a puzzler out. Now for the main topic of discussion, heart this message if you dream of opening up a D&D B&B (yes a dungeons and dragons Bed and breakfast) with nick Scott in Lancaster Pennsylvania in the heart of Amish country where we make hot scones each morning for the guests and our adopted children play Football Golf (a sport i invented) in the backyard with the 2 dogs. You also get a gift bag when you leave with a quilt (hand crocheted by me) detailing your time at the “Scott and Gold together, growing old together inn” as well as a giftcard to the tanger outlets off of route 30 (look it up) banana republic. You guys have no idea how often I make hypothetical scenarios of nick and I starting businesses together, like the 2 Jews with a brew coffee and bagel shop, where we sell the best Lox Spread Bagel in Essox county New Jersey according to SOMA (also look it up I do my research).

They say marks don’t matter, but I think I scored full ;)! He’s so attentive to my needs and he’s the only one I wanna ever depend on.

There isn’t anyone in the world who’s as caring, loving, motivated, keeping, trusting, understanding, respecting, compassionate and amazing at everything that they do other than you. You doubt yourself, while doing stuff that most people can only aspire to do, and I look up to you, and wanna do as much as I can to push you to achieve more and more in life. You have been there for me when I’ve needed you and even when I haven’t, cause you just care so much. Even in this Pandemic, you would work your ass off in the day and talk to me the whole night because of our time difference, without saying a word even when it was an inconvenience for you because of your parents. We’ve made it here, but not without you sacrificing your sleep, and doing so much more, cause you love me so much, and cause you care. It’s been so long but I don’t know how we can still talk for hours on end, each day, yet still never get bored. We can’t even finish watching a single movie in a week cause we just don’t wanna stop talking to each other, and even when we try we end up just staring in each other’s eyes. This is all because you’re the most perfect human being, you complete my existence, and I just can’t imagine my life without you. When I’m busy as hell, I still wanna talk to you, stay in the call and take my meetings, or just do something so I can see your most beautiful and pretty face, and somehow split my brains screen in half so I can always see you no matter what I’m doing, because you are what drives me, motivates me to do anything. I can’t wait to see you, and I know we miss each other so much that we might just tear up when we meet, but it’s been so long and I can’t wait for us to be in each others arms again, love you to infinity ❤️",

And in your space you’ve left a vacant wind
In opéra you played an ingénue
With blushing cheeks and timbre tamarind

Of this remember I from time to time
Between my daily walks from a to b
I think of you in prose and in a Rime
But unlike Mariners, in calmer sea

But you had passion for a bearded man
Whose hands you cuddled into when distressed
The man in question galloped to Iran
And put his sultry digits to my breast

Impermeable are my feelings though
I want you even though you love him so",

I haven’t thought about that moment in like two years, but it was probably the most embarrassing moment of my life, but I did not let that idiot deter me. After what was probably my fourth or fifth week at competitive bridge, I had a partner who Screamed at me that I was a fucking idiot and Would never be good at the game in front of everyone at the bridge club. He then sent me an email saying , “read a book on bidding, and stop your thinking that you know how to bid. That display today was pitiful. Nobody I know plays this way. If your Play doesn’t get to some resemblance of order, you will lose future partners. Today was a complete waste of time. This man was screaming at a 17-year-old kid who literally thought this mentor was the best bridge player ever. My great grandmother played back in the day and I felt like I was dishonoring her by being so bad at the game. Flash forward to now, and I am the best player at my school, consistently place very high in tournaments with world-class players, and am more in love with the game than I ever have been.

He is so funny and handsome and levelheaded and even though he doesn’t like it when I tell him he’s smart, he is just unbelievably gifted. It can be hard to believe how much easier he finds his work than anyone I’ve ever met and how hard he works anyway. He could skate by on his insane abilities but he never has, and I don’t think he ever will. 
The thing I admire most about him is the care that he gives me. He is always there for me when I need him (which is a lot) and his advice is perfect, even when I don’t want to hear it. He remembers every detail from every story I tell, and he watches comedies with me because he knows I can’t handle scary movies during Covid. He talks to me every day.

2020-12-10T01:47Z,18550,,"I spent a good part of my early teenage years dreaming of idealistic love that would sweep me off my feet, the passionate, breathless, overwhelming kind. Then I had my heart broken, many times, and I began to think that the only kind of love worth anything, would be the one that would come along when I was older- the boring, sustainable kind, the kind you find when you’re thirty and looking to settle down. 
You trudged in, slow and steady, breaking down walls, fighting all my attempts to push you away. I was terrified at how easy it was, terrified that this wasn’t the passion I secretly craved, terrified that I would find the sustainable ten years earlier than I planned. But you walked in through the door, grabbed me in your arms, and took my breath away. Like you have every day ever since. With you I find sustainability in passion, contentment in monotony, and a completeness I never imagined was possible at this very confused stage of my 21 year old life. 
I don’t know what will happen to us and where life will take us. I know that if I could choose my life right now, I would pick growing old by your side in a heartbeat over every crowning academic and professional glory I could choose to have. But, that’s irrelevant. Regardless of the future, I am so supremely grateful to you for showing me how happiness should feel, how being valued, and respected, and loved can go hand in hand with passion, (how sometimes that can mean binge watching New Girl instead of having sex) and how taking that leap of faith for love is always worth it. If not for now, if not for this, for what now and this will mean for the future. 
Word of advice from a reasonably well-experienced senior: Take the leap, kids. It works out sometimes, and when it doesn’t, it takes you closer to a time it will work out.",

You know absolutely everything, and you helped us answer our own questions by gently nudging us towards the right answer in hours and on Campuswire (and seriously, you’re the best Campuswire responder ever! Absolutely unfailingly helpful, no matter how tangential the question might have been). You have taken many of us who were nervous and panicked about our code and made us feel a whole lot better coming out of your hours with your undying belief in our braincells’ abilities. We see how much work you have put into the course, and it is well appreciated. 10/10 cheerful, 10/10 helpful, 10/10 will mercilessly kill you in electrical with the same positive attitude.

You have a super in-depth knowledge about the subject material and were super nice about answering any and all questions we may have had, sometimes multiple times just to make sure we really got it. There were times where you sat with us for nearly thirty minutes to help us on more difficult implementations, and you were always so patient and encouraging and gently nudged us away from bad code practices. Also, one of us distinctly recalls a time where they attended your 7 am hours while you were eating cornflakes, and we think that that’s gold just on its own. You’re so appreciated, and this course was a success largely because of you!

Shriram, you are absolutely god-tier. Thank you for making our intro CS class at Brown an enjoyable and overall encouraging experience. You are such a wholesome human being and a great lecturer, but more than that, we really appreciate you as a mentor. From the beginning of placement, you tried to make us more independent and aware of the fact that we now have our own responsibilities and must be cognizant of our actions, both as students and as future contributors to society. Now, at the tail end of the class, we are walking away with more than an understanding of how to program; we understand why the skills we picked up matter, and more importantly, how to ethically be using those skills in the context of today’s world. We are absolutely floored with the amount of effort you put into transitioning this course into an online format, being super open to feedback, and still covering a wide breadth of topics. If we were given the opportunity, nearly all of us would take 19 again in a heartbeat; your enthusiasm is that infectious. Now for some easter eggs: 

Do you know how to write in Pitman shorthand? 

What’s the difference between (-: and <-; ? Are there any other emojis that you save for 173? Why are they “backwards?”

Humor: students 37 and 52 not caught, overall strong joke suite; high-check
Smilies: mystifying, ominous, yet inviting; solid <-;
Ability to make me desire spending 4 hours catching a single chaff: check+
How much you will be missed: fun how-much-missed() -> Number: 1 + how-much-missed() end

With me on your side and our cats in the middle.
