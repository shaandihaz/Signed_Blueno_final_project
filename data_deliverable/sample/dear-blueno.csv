I started talking to this one dude and we've been on a couple dates and he's really cute. Last night I invited him to my appartment. We made out and then I started to make dinner for us. I felt like I was eating too much, and I said, ""Sorry, my period makes me feel like I'm starving."" He was just like, ""no worries"" and we started talking about the weather. I said ""it's so gross. It makes me feel gross"" and he was like ""I feel a little gross too. Let's take a shower."" So we're in the shower making out, and I tell him ""You know my shower is too small to be fucking in, but I can still get on my knees."" And he's just like ""nah, no thank you."" And I was really confused but I just said okay. We dried off and layed in bed and kissed and I asked him if there was anything else he wanted to do, and he's like ""no, just kissing you and holding you is amazing."" He was really sweet, but I kinda felt like a hoe. That was the rest of our night until he had to get on the bus. I talked to him later via snapchat after he left. I asked him if he enjoyed our time together and asked if I was too forward. He asked me ""have you heard of no nut November"" and so I'm fucking dead, you guys.",

I really wish all the students (undergraduates and graduates) would take into consideration of the fact that not everyone was born with a silver spoon.

I wish everyone would allow us low-income students a space to breathe without being reminded every second that we are far too different.

2018-11-18T03:26Z,19,,false,"Idk who to vent this to anymore. A lot of the courses in take about 20 hours a week outside of class. It feels like everybody is assuming that students are only taking 2 - 3 courses a sem when in fact it's 4.

CS 17 has been a super awesome course but the last few weeks were just so overwhelming. Nobody, nobody, NOBODY seemed to take into account the very difficult transition from Dr Racket to Ocaml. The lecture was rushed, the lab was long and difficult, the Subset homework during that week was very conceptually challenging.

And then there's the project Eliza, whose design check is not simple at all - you sort of have to know EVERYTHING about Eliza conceptually, and all you have left is to write the code - to get good grades on the Design Check.

Lastly, the homework is uploaded on a Thursday, with a due date on TUESDAY. Even with the late day, that is just... Really really really tough. I was just hoping for things to calm down because my other courses do require attention and those courses have exams too. But nothing's calming down. There is still a homework that is due in five days when I still haven't felt familiarized with this super weird programming language. I lowkey just want to scream. I kind of wish the homework was uploaded earlier so I could at least some of it out of the way................................................

2018-11-18T15:05Z,34,,false,"I feel like the disproportionate amount of CS-related anxiety and distress posts warrants its own page. Like a sub-page of Dear Blueno tailored to CS students. I mean, I'm no CS student, but the CS posts (besides the admiring ones, of course) fill me with such concern that I feel like we need a platform exclusively for them to handle their expansive quantity of issues. That's not to say that other departments couldn't make use of a specific complaint/problem-based platform, too. But, damn it, I can't go five posts (whether in the old BBA, the new one, or even this new page) without seeing something CS-related and I'm just like, """"OMG what is up with this department? Why are so many students complaining and their complaints seemingly not addressed? Because if they were, they'd stop being so frequent on the single most popular FB page among Brown students. This clearly isn't a Brown thing, or even a STEM thing. It's a CS thing, and it needs to stop."""" I'm sure the apparent volume of the CS department's problems are partially a consequence of the sheer size of the department, and I already know there's a group of students dedicated to improving the overall atmosphere of the department (I'm not very familiar with your work, as I don't do CS, but I'm sure it's great--the fact that you exist is a step in the right direction). But seriously, can we just take a minute to talk about this, and why it keeps happening with seemingly no loss of momentum? I know APMA has this problem, too, but its usually just 1650. There are plenty of ways to deal with a mess as isolated as a single course. But CS isn't just a single course; just to name some problematic courses off the top of my head, I've seen an abundance of posts complaining about 15, 17, and 33. And, perhaps, I have no right bringing light to an issue I have no business dealing with, but I believe my position as an outsider speaks to the fact that this problem (or series of problems) is too large to be confined to the common knowledge of a single department). 
Of course, the above sentiment should be taken with a grain of salt, as I'm assuming every post is written by a distinct person, when it could just be the same handful of people complaining about different but related things (one of the downsides of anonymous platforms like this one is that you can't use them to gauge the extent or popularity of an issue, and so """"objects in the mirror are closer than they appear""""). However, I still believe talking about the dysfunctional nature of one department has its merits. And it's not something only """"CS-students"""" should have to deal with, but something all students who've had any experiences with or within the CS department should be involving themselves in. Why leave it a CS-community issue? Why not promote it to a Brown-community issue? After all, isn't looking out for one other something Brown students are particularly known for?",

2018-11-18T19:43Z,45,,false,"@34 - I honestly don’t think there’s anything wrong with CS at brown. The department does a tremendous amount to make students feel welcome and supported, the professors are readily accessible, and the ta program provides an abundant amount of help. Also the courses are all just designed really well in general and by and large students are probably more engaged here than at most other university CS programs. The posts complaining about CS aren’t really complaining about the nature of the department, in my opinion (although things can always be tweaked for improvement) - they’re just reflections of the fact that CS is freaking hard and that sometimes, even with all the support in the world, you’re just going to have to struggle through an assignment. That’s why it can help to commisserate a bit through BBA and just relate to the fact that other kids struggle sometimes too.",

2018-11-18T22:24Z,48,,false,"I’ve been seeing a lot of posts both criticizing and defending the CS department. Everyone’s experience and their struggles are valid. Yes, waiting for 5+ hours in line even though you signed up early is terrible. Waiting for hours and hours every day only to be seen 15ish minutes, not being able to go far from the CIT, or constantly having to check the lines to see how many people are before you are all stressful. It’s also completely understandable for you to feel a lack of support. I feel it every day, especially when I’m stuck and can’t do anything about it, because I know Googling will not get me anywhere and talking to other students in the class can be like walking on a landmine because of the collaboration policy. It’s also frustrating when you see other students very obviously breaking the collaboration policy but get away with it. Either way, the list goes on. The tasks are difficult and the working conditions are stressful. That being said, I just want to say that blame shouldn’t be placed on either yourself or the CS department. It’s unfair to allocate all your blame on one or the other. I know it’s difficult, but I know you’ll get through it. If you’ve don’t, that’s also okay! There are countless people from both sides who can tell you that it’ll be fine in the end. Good luck to everyone who’s going through these struggles. We’re almost there!",

2018-11-19T17:25Z,92,,false,Hot take: the word “guys” is gender-neutral. I often say “hey guys” to a group of entirely women . fight me. words evolve. I’m from the northeast I feel fake as fuck when I say y’all. (Also not a man. or a woman. this is a voice from the gender minority biches),

2018-11-19T23:54Z,99,,false,"Dear Blueno,
I'm so tired of constantly questioning my sexuality. I'm sick of always wondering if potential feelings I may have towards someone may mean that I don't actually have the right to self-identity as my sexuality. And I can't help but wonder if sometimes I'm ignoring or pushing away my thoughts and feelings in a bid to at least keep my sexual orientation as a constant in my life.",
2018-11-19T23:55Z,100,,false,"Dear Blueno,

I'm a sophomore who's trying to rebuild their social life after a really bad end of Freshman year. I wish I could have a bunch of really close friends like I did last November, but I know these things take time. I'm getting more involved next semester, maybe I can meet new people there, too.

Thanks to all of the new people in my life who've helped me get through the past few months. I'm not super close with any of you (yet?), but you're all just so fun to be around. You've made such a big difference to my mental health.

I don't know how to express this without coming across as a half-baked Hallmark card, but I'll say it anyway. You'll never know how much small acts of positivity can influence someone else's life.",
