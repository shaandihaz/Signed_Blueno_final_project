I want to see a romantic drama in which a shy, awkward guy gets the girl. And not the most beautiful, most popular girl in a given community, but rather the charming one who listens to his problems and laughs at his jokes, someone assertive and funny and opinionated and someone who will make the first move. I love watching romantic movies, but I want a story that I can relate to. There seem to be many movies that show a wide range of feelings and emotions in females, but I want to see one that also shows these feelings and emotions in males; we have feelings too!

Perhaps an idea for the filmwriters on campus?",
