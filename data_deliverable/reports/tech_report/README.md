## Data Source

Our data is from 2 public Facebook pages where people can post anonymously. No names or identifying markers are present in the posts to the Facebook page, and while the profiles of commentors on the pages can be seen, we did not collect the likes or comments under the posts. Our BBA data consists of all posts from its beginning on September 9, 2018 until Feb 20, 2021. Our Dear Blueno data consists of all posts from its beginning on November 11, 2018 until March 19, 2020. That was the last time the Dear Blueno data was updated and given to the general community.

We received the Dear Blueno data from a public Facebook post on the Dear Blueno page. We received the BBA data privately from the mods. We consider these sources as reputable as you can get.

The data we have is complete for the specified date ranges. It contains the majority of the posts to both pages. We believe it is representative, and there is unlikely to be any sampling bias. We were unable to get an updated dataset from the Dear Blueno mods, so more recent discussions on that page are not considered by our analysis.

## Data Cleanliness
There are 19,258 posts from Dear Blueno, and 19,494 posts from BBA. We discarded 37 BBA posts, and 22 Dear Blueno posts because our parser was unable to handle them, and these posts are not included in the total. Virtually all of the discarded posts were un-numbered messages from the moderator teams of the respective pages. This is definitely enough data to perform our analysis on. 

There are some empty values in our data, but these are just indicative of an absence of a topic tag. Most posts were never updated/edited, so we did not include the updated value for those posts. All fields that are relevant to us are present. 

While the content of some posts may be identical, they would have different IDs and would reflect separate posts on Facebook.

As all the processed data files were generated by our scraper, there are no data type issues.

## Observations/Challenges

Our main goal is to gauge the sentiment of student responses on these anonymous public forums during high stress periods. For the Dear Blueno dataset, we will be using NLP sentiment analysis on the content of the posts. However, BBA posts are inherently positive, as the moderators do not allow negative posts on the page. It would not make sense to use sentiment analysis on posts we already know are positive, so instead we will be using frequency analysis to see whether people post more often during high stress times.
